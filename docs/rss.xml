<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #049</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/blog-challenge-049/</link>
<description>This is my second blog for The Weekly Challenge. I am only able to participate, thanks to Ryan Thompson for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews. I am going for Perl solutions first then will try to translate it into Raku next. I believe in coding to learn the language. With so many Raku experts around, I am not shy throwing questions up. I am now going to share my experience doing &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - 049&#x201D;.</description>

<title>The Weekly Challenge - 1000 days</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/1000-days/</link>
<description>We all know, The Weekly Challenge a.k.a Perl Weekly Challenge started on 25th March 2019. I must confess I didn&#x2019;t expect it to last this long. What worked in our favour is that we instantly found handful core supporters, who not only took part in the weekly challenge regularly but also started spreading the word. I am fortunate that they are still part of the team. While I was collecting my thoughts for the blog, I read my first RECAPS blog. You will find the format and style of RECAPS has changed a lot since.</description>

<description>Finally we reached the end of the Advent Calendar 2020. I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for Advent Calendar this year initially as I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do it. However, on the day one, I pushed myself and decided to give it a try. Now, today I am doing the last day blog for the same. Although, I didn&#x2019;t do it regularly, still I am happy with my effort.</description>

<title>HELP: How to contribute?</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute/</link>
<description>First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &#x201C;Joe Blog&#x201D; then there would be a folder called &#x201C;joe-blog&#x201D;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README. Depending on your choice of language, you should create a folder here e.g. perl for Perl and raku for Raku. Please keep everything lowercase. Inside each of these folders you can save your solutions. If it is perl script for Task #1 then call it ch-1.pl. Similarly if it is perl script for Task #2 then call it ch-2.pl. For Raku solutions, call it ch-1.raku and ch-2.raku respectively. And if you are writing one-liner then call it ch-1.sh or ch-2.sh. If you are contributing for the first time, please create your named folder as described above. Also let us know what name you would like us to use?</description>

Because of lack of time, I couldn&#x2019;t take part in the past. In the Week #046, I finally took the plunge and contributed Perl solutions to the Perl Weekly Challenge - 046.</description>

<title>A New Week a New Challenge</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-001/</link>
<description>Welcome to the first task of the &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D; event. Every Monday, we are going to propose 2 challenges, one aimed at Beginners and another for Experts. However you are free to choose the challenge you fancy. You can even attempt to solve both. As you know the choice of languages are Perl and Raku. You can solve one challenge in Perl and other in Raku, if you like.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 003</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-003/</link>
<description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository. If you need help with regard to submitting Pull Request, there is handy guide. A gentle reminder, please don&#x2019;t try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Last week, newly joined member even submit test script, which is handy but not required. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.</description>

<description>Perl Weekly Challenge introduced me to so many genious around the globe. It would be unfair to name a few. You know who I am talking about. The main objective of the project was to introduce Perl to more people and allow sharing the magic of Perl. In the last 5 weeks, I can say that I have personally learnt a lot from many greats.</description>

<title>Laurent Rosenfeld Weekly Review: Challenge - 052</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/p6-review-challenge-052/</link>
<description>Before going into the subject, I should apologize for having suspended my reviews of the Perl Weekly Challenge submissions for about two and a half months. I had warned Mohammad Anwar about that and told him the reasons, but Mohammad did not make these reasons public. The reason is that I did not have time during that period, because I had a lot of work running a local electoral campaign. I can now gradly and proudly announce that I was elected on March 15, 2020 in the city council of my home town, Conflans Sainte-Honorine (35,000 inhabitants), Paris area, France. I should hopefully have more time now to resume my reviews.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 005</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-005/</link>
<description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring. If you read the story behind each approach is amazingly blockbuster.</description>

<description>Last week was really upsetting for me, I had call from my brother (India) telling me that Dad is unwell and currently admitted in ICU. I made quick arrangement and flew to India last Friday. I met my Dad the next day at the hospital. It was an emotional re-union of Father &#x26; Son. I am planning to stay with him for a week and flying back coming Sunday. In all of these, I tried to find time to get as much covered as possible. Apology if you find things not in place this week and following week.</description>

<description>We are getting end of year 2020. I can&#x2019;t wait to get over and leave behind troublesome year. Running the weekly challenge kept me occupied through out. The main attraction these days are the contributions in guest languages. It is always pleasure to see new members joining the team and keep us busy with their solutions. Python is still #1 with 194 contributions.</description>

<description>The biggest pleasnt surprise of last week, was by Arne Sommer. He has been religiously contributing quality Raku solutions with impeccable blog every week. For the first time last week, I noticed he contributed Perl solutions. In the past, I have seen Perl contributors started contributing Raku solutions but the reversal never happend before. This is the proudest moment for me. Thanks Arne Sommer for your continuous support and encouragement.</description>

<description>Two recent tragedies really upset me the most, first the killing of George Floyd and second the killing of pregnant elephant in India. All Life Matters, including Black. I try to keep my political views to select few and avoid sharing on social media. I hope I am not crossing the lines here.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 002</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-002/</link>
<description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them. I am not saying anything wrong in this. Just sharing my point of view. I remember during the launch week, Simon Proctor nailed it with lightning fast response. However in the second week, Joelle Maslak was really quick and beat Simon Proctor. I got confused when I announced Simon Proctor was the first person to submit the solution. Simon correctly pointed out to me that Joelle Maslak actually did it before him.</description>

I know it is NOT an easy task and that too doing both. Hats off to Ryan for accepting the challenge. Team members have already appreciated his quality reviews. Please do share your suggestions.</description>

<description>I would like to this opportunity to thank one of the respected member Kian-Meng Ang for the help in reviewing Perl 5 challenges every week. Checkout her last review if you haven&#x2019;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun. I feel guilty every week not talking about Perl 6 magical solutions.</description>

<description>I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn&#x2019;t need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge. In his blog he wrote something very nice and sweet at the end.</description>

<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-013/</link>
<description>This week, Joelle Maslak sent us the first solution in Perl6 as Pull Request [#265]. Then came Scimon Proctor, again in Perl6 as Pull Request [#266]. Kevin Colyer submitted the next in Perl6 as Github gist. By now, I started thinking where are all #Perl5 hackers. I didn&#x2019;t have to wait longer, Pete Houston sent us the solution in Perl5 by email. Finally we had our first complete solution in Perl5 by Dave Jacoby as Pull Request [#271]. Chart started looking balanced.</description>

<description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.</description>

<description>Welcome to yet another week full of factorials left right center. The magic of factorials did the trick. For the first time in the history of weekly challenge, we have received more guest contributions than the regular contributions. Two contributors stand out in the crowd, although every contributor is special. Abigail and Laurent Rosenfeld, you must have guessed it by now. I would like to thank Laurent for being one of the few who have been with us from day one. I would also like to thank him for the final push to get over the magic target.</description>

He came across earlier weekly challenges and found it fun. So he decided to solve the Perl Weekly Challenge - 018 using Python language, Task #1 and Task #2. He wouldn&#x2019;t be part of weekly competition, though.</description>

<description>Welcome to the Week #110. It appears to be a really long journey. It is only possible because of all your supports and encouragements. There are couple of things that made this week very special. First, we crossed the magic numbers one more time. Last time we reached the magic numbers was in the Week #100. We did come closer to the target in the Week #106 and Week #108 with numbers 97 and 92 respectively. So well done Team PWC. Please keep the momentum going.</description>

<description>Welcome to the first Monday of the month and as you all know, it is the time of the month when I pick a champion among the Team PWC. With great pride, I announce Flavio Poletti as the next Champion of the weekly challenge. I have known Flavio long before he joined the Team PWC as someone who blog daily on Perl topics. Being the co-editor of Perl Weekly newsletter I would always look for his blog posts so that it can be part of the weekly newsletter. It is not easy to write daily blog without break for more than a year now. Flavio started with Perl contributions but later he started sharing Raku code. For the last few weeks, both Perl and Raku become his regulars. As of today, Flavio is ranked #19 with the total score of 418.</description>

<description>Today, we are 960 days old, very close to the target of 4-digits number. Congratulations to Team PWC for the support and encouragements. I am happy to see the growing popularity of guest contributions. I am glad to contribute as well although my contribution is not significant, still it feels nice. Last week, I could only share Java and Python. The best part of my contributions was it is all focussed on unit testing. I couldn&#x2019;t get Swift unit testing working in Ubuntu, so I skipped it. I will give it a go next time if time permits. I really enjoyed unit testing in Java and Python. It was my first attempt in Python. I will continue practice in coming weeks. Sometimes I wonder how Abigail, Roger Bell_West, Ulrich Rieke, Laurent Rosenfeld and others can do so many different programming languages. The quality is always the best of all. I always take the help from others everytime I am stuck. There is so much to learn from others. I am shameless when it comes to asking for help. Luckily I get help instantly everytime I post my questions on Twitter.</description>

In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&#x2019;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2]. I am really impressed. I wish him good luck.</description>

He has given us permanent space in his widely read and the most popular newsletter. I would like to thank, Elizabeth Mattijsen, creator of Rakudo Weekly Newsletter, for giving us regular space in the weekly newsletter.</description>

<description>With great pleasure, I would like to announce our inhouse Raku reviewer, Laurent Rosenfeld, is back after a short break.

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on winning local electoral campaign.</description>

<description>The week #072 was full of pleasant surprises, one of them was getting past 100 contributions. The whole Team PWC needs a big round of applause. Having set the target so high, the following week #073 was under pressure to perform. Honestly speaking, it was me who wanted to get somewhere close to the peak if not beat the previous high.</description>

<description>Welcome to the Week #105. We are almost there to complete our second year of The Weekly Challenge (a.k.a. Perl Weekly Challenge). It has been a great experience. I have never done anything on this scale before. It became possible only with the support and encouragement of Team PWC. I am happy to see Perl and Raku fans maintain the healthy relationship on this platform. There is so much respect for each other, it is unreal. Again credit goes to the maturity and understanding of Team PWC.</description>

<description>I was little late in releasing the weekly challenge last time. If I remember correctly it was around 4am Monday morning. Still, by 9am (UK time), I had first solution as PR by none other than the Scimon Procotor himself. And within the next hour, he submitted the solution to the second challenge. By lunch time, I had one more member Ozzy submitted solution to the first challenge.</description>

<description>A friend of mine, Jeff Goff (@DrForr) sadly killed in a scuba-diving accident while on vacation few days ago. I have known him for many years, mostly got to attend his talk at London Perl Workshop. I still remember his talk &#x201C;The Art of Programming&#x201D;. It was a very different experience where audience got to play with piece of paper during the entire talk. I only got the opportunity to have one-2-one conversation with him at The Perl Conference in Riga last year. I even had the pleasure to go to dinner with him one day during the conference. He was a gem of a person. He even contributed to CPAN. He would always encourage me, no matter what. Every time I post something on Twitter/Facebook, he would be the first to like or comment. He would always help me with Raku questions on Twitter.</description>

<description>Couple of months ago, on the request of one of the Team PWC member, Wanderdoc, we created Early Bird Club. So what is it all about? The club members get the first glimpse of upcoming challenges. How can anyone join the club? Just drop us a line with your intention to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. I always try to give the club members full weekend i.e. Saturday and Sunday to play with the upcoming challenges before others get their hand the following Monday morning. Currently we don&#x2019;t have many members in the club but if you are interested then please do let us know. Just to make it clear there are no strings attached to the membership. What does that mean? It means the deadline to submit the solutions is still the same like any other Team PWC members.</description>

<description>Last week, we declared Niels van Dijke the last Champion of the year 2020. We are proud to present the interview with him. As always happens, you get to know a lot about the champion. This time around, I was pleasantly surprised to know a lot about Niels. Not many of you know that Neils donated the prize money back to me. I am humbled by his gesture. Thank you, Neils. However, I strongly discourage this tradition. This is going to be the first and last time, I accept the offer. I would rather be more happy if future champion accept the small token of gift as THANK YOU from all us. You deserve it all.</description>

<description>The week #065 started on a happy note when I received the contribution by Andrew Shitov. He doesn&#x2019;t need an introduction, does he? He even blogged about his contribution. On a serious note, I got the sense that most of the Team PWC found the task Palindrome Partition very confusing. I must admit, I also realised when I solved the task myself. I noticed there are more solutions than what I thought initially. I would like to apologise for any inconvenience. I would like to suggest if you ever come across task with missing bits then please feel free to make sensible assumption and deal with the task. Don&#x2019;t forget to document your solution appropriately.</description>

I have lots of personal favourites that I always look forward to their solutions. It always brings a big smile on my face every time I look at their solutions. Sometimes, I find it difficult to grasp in first reading. But then once it settles down, the feeling is out of this world.</description>

He is someone who did Perl long time ago and currently a Chef by profession. What impressed me the most about him is that he never let his love for Perl die. I hope he finds the weekly challenge interesting to keep him going.</description>

<description>The Week #135 was special in many ways, please let me share the secrets. We breached the 100+ target once again, thanks to each and every members of Team PWC. Last time, we did it was in the Week #127. As far as guest contributions are concerned, the team didn&#x2019;t disappoint us either. I aim for 50+ guest contributions, personally. Luckily last two weeks, we achieved the target. Most of the credit goes to Abigail when it comes to guest contributiobs. He does the bulk every week.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 068</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-068/</link>
<description>Two of the three members who joined the Team PWC last week, shared solutions to the &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge - 068&#x201D;. When I requested them for a brief introduction, most of them came back with Perl background. But then Myoungjin Jeon surprised me with solutions in Raku as well. I came across one of his blog where he mentioned about his work on creating combinations in Perl in the year 2013. What more he can do now, I wonder? May be one day, he would share his knowledge in Python? It is always pleasure to meet such talented person. You get to learn a lot from them.</description>

<description>Kian-Meng Ang had been reviewing Perl Solutions since week #007. I know you all appreciated the quality review done by Kian-Meng Ang. For some reason, Kian-Meng decided to take a break from the voluntary job. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kian-Meng Ang for all the hard work. The change in team forced me take over the role. So from now on, you would see weekly review of Perl Solutions by me. I have changed the format slightly just to break the flow. I hope you are going to love it as much as you used to before. I would love to hear any suggestions to improve.</description>

<description>Last week had been the toughest week for me. My dad is now back home and doing well. Thanks each and every person for the best wishes. I know everything is messed up at the moment. I came back from India with throat infection and really bad cough. I am not fully recovered yet but still improving day-by-day. I would like to thank Ryan Thompson for doing Perl Review in my absence. There is going to be a short pause on Raku review, please bear with us, unless someone from the team volunteer to take this challenge for a short period.</description>

<description>I never miss the opportunity of celebration, no matter how small the occassion is. My form of celebration is sharing the achievements with the community in general. If you remember, I wrote a blog when we completed 3 months of weekly challenge. Then again when we completed 6 months. So why no celebration at the end of first anniversary? Certainly it was the biggest moments for all of us associated with Perl Weekly Challenge or rather The Weekly Challenge. I have plenty of excuses for not doing anything about it. In fact, I did start collecting the bits that meant a lot to all of us but then life took big turn (did I mention COVID-19?). So please hang in there, I will bring it out soon. I don&#x2019;t want to set the deadline as it puts me under immense pressure. If anyone wants to share their story then please feel free to send me over perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. It would be great to have as many success stories as possible.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 061</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-061/</link>
<description>We all know, Perl Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. However, in recent weeks, I noticed Team PWC members actively sharing solutions in other guest languages. As of today, we have received solutions in 16 guest languages, Python being the most popular language. There is still scope for more guest languages. If you haven&#x2019;t tried anything so far then why not give it a try.</description>

<title>The Weekly Challenge - 111</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-111/</link>
<description>Here we are in the Week #111. The number 111 is very special and has a story as well. I am a big fan of the game of cricket, you shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised by the fact I come from India. In the game of cricket, the number 111 is sometimes called a Nelson after Admiral Nelson, who allegdly only had One Eye, One Arm, One Leg, near the end of his life. This is in fact inaccurate as Nelson never lost a leg. So it is a big deal reaching Nelson Number, thanks to the support and encouragement of Team PWC.</description>

<description>I had great fun working with Merge Intervals task this week. I didn&#x2019;t know it was going to be more harder to solve than Noble number task. Keeping in mind the sample data provided with the task, I came up with solution very quickly. I was very happy with the result.</description>

<description>I am really enjoying the weekly challenges, specially doing in Raku. The point of blogging is also about sharing my fight with Raku. I hardly write anything about my Perl solution as I don&#x2019;t see anything new to talk about. Having said that, I still go for Perl first as it is my first love and will remain so rest of my life. Even today, my brain is so tuned to Perl, every ideas come in form and shape of Perl only. I started contributing in the Week #46. I could only find time to do Perl solutions in the Week #46. The following Week #47 was the same as I didn&#x2019;t get to do Raku. It was the Week #48 when I managed to find time to do both Perl and Raku for the first time. Ever since I have been able to contribute every week in both languages. I would give the credit to the fellow Team PWC member, Ryan Thompson, for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews.</description>

<description>Before I say anything about my contributions, I would like to share my sweet encounter with Raku. Last week while working on the task Flip Binary using Raku, I was struggling to figure out all the binary strings with maximum 1s. I had the results in a Hash where key was the binary string and value was the total count of 1s in it. The idea was to sort the Hash by values first then sort by keys. After posting the question on the Twitter handle @PerlWChallenge, I received the below solution by PawgChamp (@Mrofnet).</description>

<description>This week, I struggled with both the task, to be honest. Dealing with alpha part of the version was really pain in the neck. Every time, I struggle with any task, I follow the college days course of action i.e. pick a pend and paper. I start dribbling the thought process, it really helps in getting the idea out on the paper. Once the rough draft is ready, it is time to face the unit test trial. I make sure every solution of mine must go through the unit test trials. It flesh out edge cases most time, if I could come up with enough test cases.</description>

<description>For the first time, since I started participating the weekly challenges, I thought of doing one-liner. With handy CPAN modules, it was pretty straight forward in Perl. Even Raku with built-in features wasn&#x2019;t far behind Perl. Like in the past, I learn something new in Raku every week. This week was no different. I will share what I learnt this time later.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #055</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-055/</link>
<description>The Perl Weekly Challenge - 055 was the most difficult week for me ever since I started contributing. Usually I submit my Perl and Raku by Wednesday but this time, I was working overtime and could only finished by Sunday afternoon. I must confess that I didn&#x2019;t realise it was going to be as this difficult when I came up with the challenge. I am happy that I did it at the end of the day. This time, I submitted unit test version of both tasks in Perl and Raku. I always start with standalone app keeping in mind that this would be re-used in unit test script. I try to get the meaty subroutines drafted first then it just becomes a very thin wrapper around to get both standalone app and unit test script. My initial plan was to use bit operator to solve the Flip Binary task. Having spent couple of hours fighting, I gave up in the end. Eventually I hacked shamelessly as string to get the job done. I followed the standard pattern and solved the task in Perl first then jumped on Raku.</description>

<description>This is my second blog for The Weekly Challenge. I am only able to participate, thanks to Ryan Thompson for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews. I am going for Perl solutions first then will try to translate it into Raku next. I believe in coding to learn the language. With so many Raku experts around, I am not shy throwing questions up. I am now going to share my experience doing &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - 049&#x201D;.</description>

<description>I noticed now a days, I go for solution with unit test. I will give the credit to fellow Team PWC member, E. Choroba. It feels great when you see the test pass at the end. Well the solution looks little different than just standalone solution. For that reason, I decided to do both for Raku solutions. Also this allowed me to explore unit testing in Raku.</description>

<description> As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - 018&#x201D; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was pleasant surprise to receive solutions in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like Ada, APL, Awk, Basic, Bash, Bc, Befunge, Bourne Shell, BQN, Brainfuck, C3, C, CESIL, Chef, COBOL, Coconut, C Shell, C++, Clojure, Crystal, D, Dart, Elm, Erlang, Excel VBA, Fish, Forth, Fortran, Gembase, GNAT, Go, Haskell, Haxe, HTML, Idris, IO, J, Janet, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Kotlin, Lisp, Logo, Lua, M4, Macro Processor, Miranda, MMIX, Mumps, Myrddin, Nim, Nix, Node. </description>

<description>This weekly blog is coming a week later than normal. Why? Last week I tried Live Coding for the first time. It was scary but enjoyable experience. It took more time than the blog. Having said that I didn&#x2019;t want to stop blogging about my solutions. So here you go, I am sharing my solutions with you. Just for record, please find below links to the Live Coding videos.</description>

<description>Of the two tasks, my favourite was Shortest Unique Prefix. I must confess I have never done this before. It was fun solving though. I enjoyed it thoroughly. As always, Raku solution looks more elegant, in my hunble opinion. With every passing week, I learn something new in Raku and get to practice what I learnt so far. The weekly challenge is giving me an opportunity to explore the nitty gritty of Raku.</description>

<description>At first, I thought Product SubArray is easy task. Therefore I went public categorised as Task #1. My definition of easy task is you just start coding without doing any ground work. However when I started coding, I had to take a pause and do processing in my head befoore coding. So then as per my definition, Product SubArray no longer consider as an easy task. After finishing the task in no time once I understood the flow, it turned out to be clean solution. I must confess, my brain still do thinking as per the rules of Perl. I am hoping, one day I could do the mental processing in Raku. The IPv4 Partition task was the tough nut to crack honestly speaking at first. After working out the logic on paper, it becomes easier. Overall, fun and twisting tasks to work on.</description>

<description>I am not sure about you guys but I found writing blog is very nice feeling. I get nice ideas to clean up the code. This week, I even found a bug that even unit test couldn&#x2019;t catch. I would rather not share it, quite embarassing. The bug was in my Perl solutions to the &#x201C;Find Numbers&#x201D; task. My git commit tree might disclose it, if you really want to know.</description>

<description>The Week #068 is my 23rd week in a row participating the weekly challenge. For the first time, I created a package to deal with the &#x201C;Reorder List&#x201D; task. It really helped me in thinking straight when dealing with linked list. With the help my favourite CPAN module Moo, creating class is like piece of cake as shown below.</description>

<description>Before I talk about my contribution this week, I would like to talk about my encounter with Swift programming language recently. For the first time, I felt confident that I can share my Swift solution to the Character Swapping task of the Perl Weekly Challenge - 070. Why Task #1 only? Well, you guessed it correctly because it is meant for the beginners. With the submission of my first contribution in Guest Language, I now find myself in the Guest List as you must have seen in RECAPS every week. In the next edition of RECAPS, you would see my name in the list with other prominent guests. Ever since I started the Guest List, I always wanted to be a part of it but never had the courage to try new language other than Perl and Raku. While I am talking about Guest List, I would like to mention the first guest who started the trend was Orestis Zekai with the Python contributions in the Week #018.</description>

<description>With another Linked List related task, I am now enjoying it a lot. It also gives me the opportunity to work with Class in Raku. Learning Raku has changed my thinking a big way. The developer inside me is more organised than before. Also doing regular weekly challenge made me think from unit test point of view every time I come up with a solution. In fact, it dictates the design of my solution. Now with the regular Live Video Raku Reviews by Andrew Shitov gave me the insights of others Raku solutions. It is amazing how he break the code into pieces to make it easy to understand. No book can teach you that. You only learn from experience or watching video from Andrew Shitov.</description>

<description>First thing first, I managed to do video session for both tasks this week. It is so satisfying when everything goes as per the plan. For the last couple of weeks, I could only do one video session. One day, I would like to video with PIP. At the moment, I am little uncomfortable showing my face in the video. There is another reason why I can&#x2019;t do it now. I don&#x2019;t have my personal office in the house. I have been working from home since mid-March, nearly 6 months, sitting on sofa, 9-5. I must confess it is not easy. I miss my office chair and noise-free environment. I have 3 years twin girls. Luckily the school started last week, I get no-noise moment for few hours during the day. Also this week, I found time to do coding in Swift.</description>

<description>This week, both tasks were comparatively easier than last week. I followed the rule, doing Perl first then translating the same into Raku. But while working on Raku, I got fresh ideas. I then went back to my Perl and re-worked the logic. One day, I would like to do Raku first then translate it into Perl.</description>

<description>The week #075 tasks turned out to be a lot trickier than expected. Generally Task #1 is meant for beginners only but this time it was not the case. It wasn&#x2019;t my plan when I proposed the task. I thought couple of for-loops and job done. But when I actually started working on the task, I realised it wasn&#x2019;t as simple as I thought initially. But the good thing is, I got to know about Dynamic Programming (DP).</description>

<description>Once again, Neil Bowers, came up with another exciting task for all Team PWC members. Like always, it was fun task. Thanks to Ryan for providng sample data and expected result based on the definition of the task. Half the job done already. The only thing left for the us, is get on with the job. I noticed Raku needed slightly different approach then the Perl. It could be I am doing something very badly. I am happy to correct myself, if you find anything silly. More on this, later down below.</description>

<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-077/</link>
<description>I am back to my routine life but still not there fully. I am going to talk about my Perl and Raku solutions to both tasks to start with. Last week, I only talked about my Perl and Raku solutions to the task Prime Sum. This week also, I skipped Swift contributions like last week, sorry. I would blame my laziness.</description>

<title>Project: Rename Perl6 to Raku</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/welcome-raku/</link>
<description>I had been planning to kick start the mini project of renaming Perl6 to Raku on the official website of &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;. And the side project to this, shouldn&#x2019;t it be called &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - Perl &#x26; Raku&#x201D;? This is sticky area and needed more time to go through various aspects. Renaming project wasn&#x2019;t too difficult to deal with but I was looking for some FREE time to do it properly.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #063</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-063/</link>
<description>After the most difficult week (Week #062), it was very satisfying. I found both the tasks this week (Week #063) fun and challenging. The best part was that I could do both tasks in an hour, which is rare. I liked the &#x201C;Rotate String&#x201D; task very much. Thanks to Ryan, we already had test cases handy for the &#x201C;Last Word&#x201D; task. I will talk about each in detail down below.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #059</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-059/</link>
<description>This week, I changed the format of my weekly blog slightly. Why? Well, I wanted to keep the Perl and Raku solutions next to each other so that it is easier for reader (me, mostly) to see the difference. It gives me immense pleasure to see the end result when I am done translating Perl solutions into Raku. It looks lot cleaner and precise. The only thing it is behind is performance when I do comparison. For that I would blame myself partly as I am still learning the magic of Raku. For now, my objective is to wire my brain according to the rules of Raku. Once it is wired properly and stable then I would start playing the trick with it. That is the plan, how far I am going to succeed is another matter. I am not in rush to be honest. The central GitHub Repository is the collection of many gems by so many Raku experts. I know for sure, if I struggle in future then I can easily look for better solutions in the bank.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #076</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-076/</link>
<description>Although I had finished the &#x201C;Word Search&#x201D; task a week before, still I didn&#x2019;t have time to complete the &#x201C;Prime Sum&#x201D; task. After checking out others solution to the &#x201C;Word Search&#x201D; task, I was feeling low looking back my own solution. To recover from it, I delayed solving the &#x201C;Prime Sum&#x201D; task. At the same time, as a protest, I didn&#x2019;t do Swift solutions for any of the tasks. After few days when I was feeling a little better, I decided to do at least one task better.</description>

<title>About Us</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/about/</link>
<description> We are a team of Perl and Raku hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from each other. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. The main point is that you don&#x27;t need to be an expert in the language. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenges to start with. Take me for example, I have recently started learning Raku and I will be taking on easy challenges to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on a newbie and give a helping hand.  &#x22;The photo isn&#x27;t us but it came with the theme, so we are using it.&#x22; </description>

<title>FAQ</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/faq/</link>
<description>You can send a one line email to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. However we would like you to tell us about yourself in couple of lines e.g. your preferred choice of language, how long you have been using the language, your city and country. If you could send us a recent photo to show on the team page then that would be great, but it isn&#x27;t required.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #069</title>
<link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-069/</link>
<description>The Task #1 of Perl Weekly Challenge - 069 raised a very interesting question i.e. is 1 strobogrammatic number? So far, I got mixed response some says yes and some not. My first thought was Yes, it is but later changed my mind. It is controversial and I don&#x2019;t want loose the focus on the task itself. Please remember the objective is to have fun and not to get into controversial domain. I am also very flexible and not tied to any thing. Some even discussed that &#x201C;upside down&#x201D; is not same as &#x201C;180 degree rotation&#x201D;. I am staying away from it. I like the open culture of Perl Weekly Challenge as you are free to take the route you are comfortable with. There are no compulsion.</description>

<description> ( &#x2026;continues from previous week. ) Welcome to the Perl review pages for Week 149 of The Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered up by the team, factor out some common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created. &#xE2;&#x97;&#x8F;&#xEF;&#xB8;&#x8E; Why do we do these challenges? I suppose any reasonable answer to that question would be from a field as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team. </description>

<description> Damian Conway wrote a blog in the last week of May 2019 and confessed that he has been quietly playing at home with &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;. With this started the regular blog by him picking weekly challenge and presenting his views. I didn&#x2019;t want to loose the track of all his great work, so I decided to put together all his blogs dealing with various challenges in one place. It would be a great read for anyone interested in the detailed analysis. </description>

<description> ( &#x2026;continues from previous week. ) Welcome to the Perl review pages for Week 149 of The Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered up by the team, factor out some common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created. &#xE2;&#x97;&#x8F;&#xEF;&#xB8;&#x8E; Why do we do these challenges? I suppose any reasonable answer to that question would be from a field as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team. </description>
