      <description>Advent Calendar 2020
 The gift is presented by Yet Ebreo. Today he is talking about his solution to the task Calling C function of &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 029&amp;rdquo;. This is re-produced for Advent Calendar 2020 from the original post by Yet Ebreo.
  Write a script to demonstrate calling a C function. It could be any user defined or standard C function.
  I have seen implementation of this using the Inline module but I have to be honest that I have never really tried it in perl.</description>

      <description>As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 018&amp;rdquo; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was pleasant surprise to receive solutions in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like APL, Awk, Basic, Bash, Bc, Befunge, Brainfuck, C, Chef, Cobol, C Shell, C++, Clojure, Elm, Erlang, Fish, Forth, Fortran, Gembase, GNAT, Go, Haskell, HTML, Idris, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Lisp, Lua, Mumps, Node, OCaml, Ook, Pascal, PHP, Python, Postscript, Prolog, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, SQL, Swift, Tcl and XSLT.</description>
