      <description>As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to The Weekly Challenge - 018 by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was pleasant surprise to receive solutions in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like Ada, APL, Awk, BASIC, Bash, Bc, Befunge-93, Bourne Shell, BQN, Brainfuck, C3, C, CESIL, Chef, COBOL, Coconut, C Shell, C++, Clojure, Crystal, D, Dart, Dc, Elixir, Elm, Emacs Lisp, Erlang, Excel VBA, F#, Factor, Fennel, Fish, Forth, Fortran, Gembase, Gleam, GNAT, Go, GP, Groovy, Haskell, Haxe, HTML, Hy, Idris, IO, J, Janet, Java, JavaScript, Julia, K, Kap, Korn Shell, Kotlin, Lisp, Logo, Lua, M4, Maxima, Miranda, Modula 3, MMIX, Mumps, Myrddin, Nelua, Nim, Nix, Node.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. 1. Introduction 2. Setup LocalStack 3. Lambda Function 4. Using aws 5. Using Python 6. Using Perl Introduction  This post comes nearly a month and a half after the last one. The previous post on an AWS related topic was about AWS DynamoDB. The break wasn&amp;rsquo;t intentional, though.
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without having to manage servers.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. 1. Introduction 2. Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C) 3. Using aws 4. Using Python 5. Using Perl Introduction  Continuing the blog series on AWS encryption, this post focuses on Server-Side Encryption using Customer-Provided Keys.
Previously, I covered the other two types of Server-Side Encryption i.e. S3 Encryption and KMS Encryption.
In this type of encryption, customer generates and manages the encryption key.
AWS does not store customer keys, they must be provided with every API request.</description>
