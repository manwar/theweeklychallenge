      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. 1. Introduction 2. Setup Environment 3. Using aws 4. Using Python 5. Using Perl Introduction  Recently I shared my experience with Amazon S3 and Amazon Lambda.
Today I am playing with S3 Bucket Events and how it can be triggered and captured.
In this post, I will take a closer look at the following events.
s3:ObjectCreated:Put s3:ObjectCreated:Copy s3:ObjectCreated:Post s3:ObjectCreated:CompleteMultipartUpload s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete Setup Environment  As with all other AWS related experiments, I want LocalStack running in a docker container.</description>

It is designed for high availability, scalability and low-latency performance.
It is a popular choice for modern applications that require fast and flexible data storage.
Unlike traditional relational databases, DynamoDB is schemaless, meaning it does not require a fixed table structure.</description>

Previously, I covered the other two types of Server-Side Encryption i.e. S3 Encryption and KMS Encryption.
In this type of encryption, customer generates and manages the encryption key.
AWS does not store customer keys, they must be provided with every API request.</description>
