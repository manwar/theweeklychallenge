      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Angry at Bash  I have noticed a very weird behavior in bash recently that I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen in my entire career of over two and a half decades.
Look at this one line to create a text file:
$ echo &amp;#34;Hello World!!&amp;#34; &amp;gt; hello.txt 
This is what one does as a quick win, right?
What would you expect?</description>
