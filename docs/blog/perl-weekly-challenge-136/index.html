<br>
<p>The <code>Week #135</code> was special in many ways, please let me share the secrets. We breached the <code>100+</code> target once again, thanks to each and every members of <strong>Team PWC</strong>. Last time, we did it was in the <code>Week #127</code>. As far as guest contributions are concerned, the team didn&rsquo;t disappoint us either. I aim for <code>50+</code> guest contributions, personally. Luckily last two weeks, we achieved the target. Most of the credit goes to <code>Abigail</code> when it comes to guest contributiobs. He does the bulk every week.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="anything-else-special-happens-last-week">Anything else special happens last week?</h3>
<br>
<p>Well, you all know, I used to contribute <strong>Raku</strong> solutions long time ago. I have also contributed in <strong>Swift</strong> as well. Last week, I finally decided to get back contributing in <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-135/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku"><strong>Raku</strong></a>. Not only that I contributed in <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-135/mohammad-anwar/swift/ch-1.swift"><strong>Swift</strong></a> as well. I surprised myself by contributing in <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-135/mohammad-anwar/python/ch-1.py"><strong>Python</strong></a> for the first time. I have been waiting for easy enough task to get my first contribution out. The <code>Week #135</code> finally gave me the opportunity. I didn&rsquo;t stop there and contributed <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-135/mohammad-anwar/java/MiddleThreeDigits.java"><strong>Java</strong></a> solution as well. The end result of all these guest contributions, is I am back in the <code>Top 20</code> guest contributors. I used to be in the <code>Top 15</code> long time ago then I started slipping down. And at one time, I was dropped to <code>21st</code> position. I am happy to find the positive energy in me. Fingers crossed, I hope it stays there for sometime. One thing that I wanted to do for months is that doing live coding session. I will do my best to get my hand dirty with some simple live coding. I really enjoy it. I have had many encouraging messages with regard to my live coding session. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the subscribers for the support and encouragement.</p>

<h3 id="sunday-morning-didnt-start-on-happy-note-for-me-why">Sunday morning didn&rsquo;t start on happy note for me, why?</h3>
<br>
<p>I lost my <strong>Sky Broadband</strong> connection. I panicked as it is so difficult to manage all the routine tasks without internet connection. I called the support team and they said some maintenance work is going on in my area. It would take around <code>24 hours</code> to get the connection back. I immediately shared the news with the team on <a href="https://twitter.com/PerlWChallenge"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>. The comments I received for my post brought smile back on my face. I loved the positivity among my friends on the various social platform. I am glad I choose the right people around me. Luckily I didn&rsquo;t have to wait that long, I got the connection back around <code>10pm</code>. Every member of my immediate family knows how busy I am on Sunday normally. I spent the afternoon watching the <code>T20 World Cup 2021</code> match between <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Pakistan</strong>. The humiliating defeat of the <strong>Indian</strong> team really upset me. For the first time, my 11 year old daughter watched the match with me. To my surprise, she was supporting the <strong>Pakistan</strong> team. She was very happy to say the least in the end. Never mind, we will get the opportunity to take the glory back.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="what-else-is-going-on">What else is going on?</h3>
<br>
<p><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-016"><strong>Adam Russell</strong></a> and <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-08"><strong>Cheok-Yin Fung</strong></a>, the two champions, came together started really interesting discussion. I would like to share this with the rest of team. Please let me know what do you think by your comments in the <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/issues/5055"><strong>thread</strong></a>.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="raku-contributions-need-an-expert-reviewer">Raku contributions need an expert reviewer.</h3>
<br>
<p>We have been waiting for a volunteer to help us review the <strong>Raku</strong> contributions just like how <code>Colin Crain</code> has been doing for <strong>Perl</strong> solutions. I don&rsquo;t expect one person to do it all. Even if you can do it one or two weeks that would be great. Please let me know if you have spare time.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h3>
<br>
<p>As you all know, we have dedicated space for <code>Damian Conway</code> and <code>Andrew Shitov</code> (our inhouse Raku expert and reviewer) every week in the weekly <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/recaps"><strong>Recaps</strong></a> blog. I am thinking of adding one more to showcase the collection of <code>Abigail</code> regex magic. It is for my own benefit, so that I don&rsquo;t have to look around anywher else. Right now, I am on a very tight schedule to fit this work. I was wondering, if anyone from the team can help me in this work.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="hacktoberfest-is-coming-to-an-end-soon">Hacktoberfest is coming to an end soon.</h3>
<br>
<p>You have one more week to participate in the ongoing the annual event and win a specially designed <strong>T-shirt</strong>. Mind you, it would be delivered to your door step for <strong>FREE</strong> anywhere in the world. If you are looking for ideas then why not take part in the weekly challenge and win the prize.</p>

<p>Our solo sponsor <code>Pete Sergeant</code> has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank <strong>Pete</strong> and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn&rsquo;t have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.</p>

<h2 id="TASK1">TASK #1 › Two Friendly</h2>
<h5 id="submitted-by-mohammad-s-anwarhttpwwwmanwarorg"><strong>Submitted by:</strong> <a href="http://www.manwar.org">Mohammad S Anwar</a></h5>
<hr>
<p>You are given 2 positive numbers, <code>$m</code> and <code>$n</code>.</p>
<p>Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are <code>Two Friendly</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when gcd(m, n) = 2 ^ p where p &gt; 0. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set of numbers is the largest positive number that divides all the numbers in the set without remainder.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>
<pre><code>    Input: $m = 8, $n = 24
    Output: 1

    Reason: gcd(8,24) = 8 =&gt; 2 ^ 3
</code></pre>
<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>
<pre><code>    Input: $m = 26, $n = 39
    Output: 0

    Reason: gcd(26,39) = 13
</code></pre>
<h4 id="example-3">Example 3</h4>
<pre><code>    Input: $m = 4, $n = 10
    Output: 1

    Reason: gcd(4,10) = 2 =&gt; 2 ^ 1
</code></pre>

<h2 id="TASK2">TASK #2 › Fibonacci Sequence</h2>
<h5 id="submitted-by-mohammad-s-anwarhttpwwwmanwarorg-1"><strong>Submitted by:</strong> <a href="http://www.manwar.org/">Mohammad S Anwar</a></h5>
<hr>
<p>You are given a positive number <code>$n</code>.</p>
<p>Write a script to find how many different sequences you can create using Fibonacci numbers where the sum of unique numbers in each sequence are the same as the given number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fibonacci Numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="example--1">Example  1</h4>
<pre><code>Input:  $n = 16
Output: 4

Reason: There are 4 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
i.e. (3 + 13), (1 + 2 + 13), (3 + 5 + 8) and (1 + 2 + 5 + 8).
</code></pre>
<h4 id="example--2">Example  2</h4>
<pre><code>Input:  $n = 9
Output: 2

Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
i.e. (1 + 3 + 5) and (1 + 8).
</code></pre>
<h4 id="example--3">Example  3</h4>
<pre><code>Input:  $n = 15
Output: 2

Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
i.e. (2 + 5 + 8) and (2 + 13).
</code></pre>
