                    <p>( <em>&hellip;continues from <a href="/blog/review-challenge-095/">previous week</a>.</em> )</p>
<p>Welcome to the Perl review for <strong>Week 096</strong> of the Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the  submissions offered by the team, factor out the common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-do-we-do-these-challenges">Why do we do these challenges?</h3>
<p>I suppose any answers to that would be as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team. One thing is clear: it&rsquo;s not a competition, and there are no judges, even if there is a &ldquo;prize&rdquo; of sorts. About that &ndash; I think of it more as an honorarium periodically awarded to acknowledge the efforts we make towards this strange goal. So there&rsquo;s no determination to find the <em>fastest</em>, or the <em>shortest</em>, or even, in some abstract way, the <em>best</em> way to go about things, although I&rsquo;m certain the individuals have their own aspirations and personal drives. As Perl is such a wonderfully expressive language, this provides quite a bit of fodder to the core idea of TMTOWTDI, producing a gamut of wonderfully varied techniques and solutions.</p>
<p>Even the tasks themselves are often open to a certain amount of discretionary interpretation. What we end up with is a situation where each participant is producing something in the manner they find the most interesting or satisfying. Some team members focus on carefully crafted complete applications that thoroughly vet input data and handle every use case they can think up. Others chose to apply themselves to the logic of the underlying puzzle and making it work in the most elegant way they can. Some eschew modules they would ordinarily reach for, others embrace them, bringing to light wheels perhaps invented years ago that happen to exactly solve the problem in front of them today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been considering this question for some time and have found one binding commonality between all of us solving these challenges each week, in that however we normally live our lives, the task in front of us more than likely has nothing to do with any of that . And I think this has great value. We all do what we do, out in the real world, and hopefully we do it well. The Weekly Challenge provides a opportunity to do something germane to that life yet distinctly different; if we only do the things we already know how to do we only do the same things over and over. This is where the &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; aspect comes into play.</p>
<p>So we can consider the Weekly Challenge as providing a problem space outside of our comfort zone, as far out from comfort as we wish to take things. From those reaches we can gather and learn things and bring what we want back into our lives. Personally, I think that&rsquo;s its greatest value of all.</p>
<hr>
<p>Every week there is an enormous global collective effort made by the team, analyzing and creatively coding the submissions, and that effort deserves credit due. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, to try and figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look and see what we can find.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><big>For context</big></strong>  before we begin, you may wish to revisit either of the pages for the <a href="/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-096/"><strong>original tasks</strong></a> or the summary <a href="/blog/recap-challenge-096/"><strong>recap</strong></a> of the challenge. But don&rsquo;t worry, the challenges themselves will be briefly summarized, presented below as we progress from task by task. Oh, and one more thing before we get started:</p>

<h1 id="PWC096TASK1">TASK 1</h1>
<h1 id="reverse-words">Reverse Words</h1>
<p><em>Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar</em></p>
<p>You are given a string $S.</p>
<p>Write a script to reverse the order of words in the given string. The string may contain leading/trailing spaces. The string may have more than one space between words in the string. Print the result without leading/trailing spaces and there should be only one space between words.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code>    Input: $S = &quot;The Weekly Challenge&quot;
    Output: &quot;Challenge Weekly The&quot;
</code></pre><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code>    Input: $S = &quot;    Perl and   Raku are  part of the same family  &quot;
    Output: &quot;family same the of part are Raku and Perl&quot;
</code></pre><h2 id="about-the-solutions">about the solutions</h2>
<p>There were only 20 working submissions for the first task this past week.</p>
<p>You know, it was difficult to watch otherwise good, hardworking people brought down by a single space. It&rsquo;s hard to see. It hurts, you know? Inside.</p>
<p><em>(shakes head, muttering unintelligibly)</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not right.</p>
<p>Although a basic solution to the challenge might appear fairly trivial on the surface — to use <code>split</code>, then reverse and join up the resultant array — the problems arose with the normal behavior between <code>split</code> and matching the given delimiter right off the bat. Now normally, <code>split</code> matches and adds an element to the new array with whatever was before the delimiter, <em>whether or not there is anything to divide</em>. The function then continues, position by position, looking to match the next delimiter. Which is to say when we have whitespace as the delimiter and immediately match leading whitespace, an element is created nevertheless, with an undefined, empty value. If we <code>reverse</code> the array and <code>join</code> with a single space the undefined element will be joined alongside the others. Although the undefined element will itself produce no output, the <code>join</code> will leave an artifact of a trailing space.</p>
<p>Which we were quite clearly told not to do.</p>
<p>So the challenge transforms under us from reversing the words, the stated goal, to getting rid of those pesky spaces. The old switcheroo, you might say. Misdirection.</p>
<h2 id="trim">TRIM</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/duncan-c-white/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Duncan C. White</strong></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/polettix/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Flavio Poletti</strong></a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/lubos-kolouch/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Lubos Kolouch</strong></a></p>
<p>It makes perfect intuitive sense that a string composed of just words divided by spaces, when broken apart at the spaces, will produce an array of words that can be reversed without incident. So if we can trim the string to our ideal outlined above, we&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>As an aside we&rsquo;re only looking out for <em>leading</em> whitespace. <em>Trailing</em> whitespace will always be deleted unless explicitly requested with a <code>LIMIT</code> value. Without a <code>LIMIT</code> specified for our <code>split</code>, as is found in all the cases before us today, <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/split">perldoc</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If LIMIT is omitted (or, equivalently, zero), then it is usually treated as if it were instead negative but with the exception that trailing empty fields are stripped (empty leading fields are always preserved); if all fields are empty, then all fields are considered to be trailing (and are thus stripped in this case).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t see those.</p>
<p>The simple insertion of a substitution regex to preclean the string will do the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/duncan-c-white/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Duncan C. White</strong></a></p>
<p>Duncan does the obvious thing, which is to trim the string of extra whitespace with a pair of substitutions anchored to the front and back. Trimming the tail neatens things up and ultimately causes no harm, of course.</p>

<p>Lubos realized that only the leading space was causing a problem, and we only need to address that aspect. Although I <em>would</em> argue that it&rsquo;s misattributed — that the extra space on the reversed string is actually left by the <code>join</code>, rather than the <code>split</code>. The <code>split</code> leaves an undefined element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl">    <span style="color:#75715e"># split leaves the initial space</span>
    $what <span style="color:#f92672">=~</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">s/^\s+//</span>;

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span>  join <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39; &#39;</span>, reverse split <span style="color:#e6db74">/\s+/</span>, $what;
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/polettix/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Flavio Poletti</strong></a></p>
<p>Flavio takes a different approach to trimming. If the problem is an artifact of an extra trailing space in the result, why not just remove the space?

<p>Another way to look at the situation is to focus on the undefined array element. Were it not there we&rsquo;d have nothing to complain about, would we? So what would happen if it just&hellip; went away? You know, snicker-snack with the ol&rsquo; vorpal blade? The only one to miss it would be our over-eager <code>join</code>.</p>
<p>By placing an appropriate <code>grep</code> function to intercept the array after splitting we can filter out the undefind element and allow the others to pass through unchecked. Unfortuantely though this whole strategy was fraught with peril. Consider, though, that all these methods did pass my ad hoc definition of &ldquo;working&rdquo;, as I will explain.</p>

clarified, so can we be certain there is no sentence where this would fail? After all, in Perl there are lots of special characters. For instance, the &ldquo;$&rdquo; sign is used as what is known as a &ldquo;sigil&rdquo;. See what I did there?</p>
<p>Transmogrified: <strong>&ldquo;sigil&rdquo;. a as known is what as used is sign the instance, For</strong></p>
<p>&hellip;And our &ldquo;$&rdquo; is gone like it was never there.</p>
<p>In summary, there is nothing fundimentally wrong with the idea of filtering our array to extract the words, but we need to be very careful about our definitions and about craft our regex accordingly.</p>
<p>Alternately, it was more common to grep on <code>$_</code> to prove  existence:</p>

<p>Dave goes to great length to grapple with these ideas I&rsquo;ve brought up, and gives a well thought out analysis to the situation. He brings up the confounding case of an apostrophe, for instace, which is not a word character. To sidestep this he splits on <a href="https://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2016/06/perl-v5-22-adds-fancy-unicode-word-boundaries/">unicode word boundaries</a> and then greps on <em>non-</em> space characters. This is in my mind a sneaky gambit and I approve.</p>

<p>Taking a step sideways from all this definition of what is and is not a word, there was another way to obtain the correct results, by utilizing a non-standard quirk of the <code>split</code> function. You see, Perl was originally created out of, amongst other things, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, two early Unix command line tools for text processing. It was meant to build on these tools and improve them, to make Larry&rsquo;s life easier, and as such inherits some behavior from its anticedents. Like for instance the alternate <code>y///</code> syntax for the translation operator <code>tr///</code>, which is shamelessly stolen from <code>sed</code>. In this case we&rsquo;re copying <code>awk</code>. From <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/split">perldoc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As another special case, &ldquo;split&rdquo; emulates the default behavior of the command line tool awk when the PATTERN is either omitted or a string composed of a single space character (such as <code>' '</code> or <code>&quot;\x20&quot;</code>, but not e.g. <code>&quot;/ /&quot;</code>). In this case, <strong>any leading whitespace in EXPR is removed before splitting occurs</strong>, and the PATTERN is instead treated as if it were <code>&quot;/\s+/&quot;</code>; in particular, this means that <em>any</em> contiguous whitespace (not just a single space character) is used as a separator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. By stripping leading whitespace, this seems to do exactly what we need, which is does. No undefined element is created, so no trailing space is produced.</p>

<p>There were 23 functional submissions for the second task this past week.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-the-levenshtein-distance">a note on the Levenshtein distance</h3>
<p>In this task we speak often of the Levenshtein distance, being the edit distance allowing the three operations as specified. In the examples, each operation is tallied as one change: to either insert, delete of replace. One oddity I found researching this is that apparently Levenshtein himself, in his seminal 1965 paper, gave the substitution operation a cost of 2, as a deletion followed by an insertion. I was unable to find a translation of the original paper to verify for myself, but it&rsquo;s telling that in about half the examples I could find from academic sources the cost was given as 2, the other half 1. As a practical programming algorithm the cost was nearly always 1, but again in several cases 2. It&rsquo;s a puzzle. At some point the standard form of the calculation changed, and one cannot assume without looking whether one value or the other are used. Needless to say different effects will be produced, and different relative comparative indicators of absolute difference between sets of words will arise, so the values are not arbitrary and interchangeable.  It&rsquo;s also strange to me that not one of the sources I read acknowledged this difference, or allowed a configuration to be set. Each source picked one or the other for its definition, as the way things were, without compromise. As the metric only generally exists for comparisons within a given application this difference generally won&rsquo;t matter. But I find it very odd that I appear to be the only person making a big deal about it. It&rsquo;s strange, that&rsquo;s all, and after extensive research I seem to be at a standstill. If anyone might help to shed some light on the subject I&rsquo;d be glad to hear it.</p>

<p>In the basic recursive method, we build up an answer to our question by comparing the first two characters of our two strings. If they are the same, no action is required, and we immediately recurse with the remaining character segment. If they don&rsquo;t match, we need to add one change to our count, after which we are faced with three options in converting the old string to the new: to remove a character from the old, allowing the next position to slide into place, insert a new character into the new, pushing the current position forward to the next, or substitute a new character for the old, keeping the relative correspondance between the two strings unchanged. Because this is a naive algorithm, we recurse down after each of the three options with the remaining lengths of string, adjusted according to the rules we&rsquo;ve stated. The base case is returned when we run out of one string or the other, which is the length of the remaining other string.</p>
<p>By choosing the minimum value returned by the three paths at each recursion, we walk the tree in all possible configurations. The final returned result after unwinding will be the smallest number of changes required to make the transformation.</p>
<p>Because every recursive node has three options and every option is always visited, we will end up with complexity of <strong>O</strong>(3<sup>min(<em>m</em>,<em>n</em>)</sup>).</p>

<p>When following every option at every node, many of the recursions will end up being called with identical arguments. To speed things up we can check to see whether that computation has already been done, and if so return instead a cached result. This method, called memoization, is easily accomplished using the <code>Memoize</code> module. All we need to do is declare the routine to be memoized and the rest magically falls into place.</p>

<p>Laurent ups the game on the memoizing part of the recursion, creating his own wrapper function to cache the results from his main routine. Checking the arguments given against previously computed values, either the cached result is returned or the routine is run and the result added to the cache.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different here is that Laurent has embraced the &ldquo;decorator&rdquo; design pattern to implement this. Now Perl doesn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> decorator functions out of the box, say like Python. So for the uninitiated, a decorator is a function designed to non-destructively change the behavior of another function, without directly altering its code. So Laurent here gives us a <code>decorate</code> function, which takes another function as a coderef argument. It then creates an anonymous modified version of this function, in this case enacting the memoization cache check, then returns a coderef to this new anonymous routine. Then the <em>really</em> cool part comes in, where he patches the symbol table with this coderef so that calls to the original function are silently rerouted to the decorated, memoized version. Now that, <em>that</em> is really cool.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm">Wagner-Fischer algorithm</a> is a neat little dynamic programming improvement over naive recursion, where increasingly longer substrings between the two inputs are compared, with the shorter results memoized and used to compute the longer. Constructing the matrix of partial results has much in common with the recursive method, exploring every possible pathway, the difference being that at every juncture we can selectively make a decision and chose to only follow the shortest path, reducing the complexity to <strong>O</strong>(<em>m</em>+<em>n</em>).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/wanderdoc/perl/ch-2.pl"><strong>Wanderdoc</strong></a></p>
<p>The learned one gives us the essence of the technique. In it we build a matrix through a nested iteration, choosing at each cell the minimum from the three options available to determine the shortest distance.</p>

<p>When constructing the matrix for the dynamic solution, the cells are filled in a methodical manner, left to right and top to bottom, with the calculation for each successive placement determined only by one of the three cells adjacent above, to the left and diagonally up and back. As such only two rows are ever in play at any one time, the row currently being constructed and the row previous. The dynamic algorithm can be altered to only retain these rows, drastically reducing memory requirements without otherwise affecting the calculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-096/abigail/perl/ch-2.pl"><strong>Abigail</strong></a></p>
<p>Abigail accomplishes this memory saving with a very standard-looking version of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm, with the additional step of undefining rows no longer needed. All of the indexing remains unchanged, however those parts of the matrix no longer needed will now take up minimal memory.</p>

<p>What the dynamic programming matrix is accomplishing is basically doing a flood fill from the upper left-hand corner to the lower right, following the path of minimal values to populate each cell.</p>
<p>Using this as his model, Choroba constructs his decision tree in a slightly different manner, but winds up in the same place.</p>

<p>James opens with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to add &ldquo;Another day job challenge!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure <em>exactly</em> what James&rsquo; job description is, so we&rsquo;ll just go with the term &ldquo;geneticist&rdquo; for now. Comparing long strings of the letters G, T, C and A comes part and parcel to that territory, and coming from that direction he brings us a different way to do things, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm">Smith–Waterman</a> algorithm.</p>
<p>The focus of Smith–Waterman is not to find a path of transformation from one string to the other, but rather to pair up common nucleotide runs, and note differences between them. The output shows these correspondences, along with other notation signifying mismatches and the addition and deletion of elements.</p>
<p>For example, &lsquo;boat riding&rsquo; to &lsquo;bat ridding&rsquo;:</p>
<pre><code>    boat rid-ing
    |^||||||v||| (2)
    b-at ridding
</code></pre><p>or &lsquo;kitten&rsquo; to &lsquo;sitting&rsquo;:</p>
<pre><code>    kitten-
     ||| |v (3)
    sitting
</code></pre><p>The goal here is not to <em>alter</em> the data, only to align it to find common sections and make them visible. As such we are delivered essentially a descriptive alignment map between the two. To convert from this to an edit distance we need only count the characters that <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> a vertical pipe, being a space, carat or vee. In his output above he includes this count in the parenthesized numbers after the alignment string.</p>
<p>James also provides an abridged version. Notice how when put it like this how similar it appears to the memoized recursive Levenshtein distance we saw earlier.</p>

</code></pre><p>By this point you should be familiar with the basic components of the Wagner-Fischer dynamic programming algorithm: building the array of partial results and taking the minimum pathway from the options calculated by earlier, smaller substring comparisons. In the well commented PDL version presented you should be able to observe and follow the same processes. The 2x2 matrix, for example, represents the cell and the three options — to the left, above and diagonal, representing insertion, deletion and substitution, with substitution of the same letter costing nothing.</p>
<p>I find this a wonderful way to familiarize myself with the power of this exotic data-processing extension to the language. Although the syntax may at times be mysterious, after examining the algorithm elsewhere (with a little helpful commentary), we can glean the internal workings of the process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with the whole thing here for you unabridged, to encourage everyone to gaze upon its radient splendor. I think it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
