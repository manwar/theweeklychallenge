                    <p>( <em>&hellip;continues from <a href="/blog/review-challenge-087/">previous week</a>.</em> )</p>
<p>Welcome to the Perl review for <strong>Week 088</strong> of the Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the  submissions offered by the team, factor out the common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-do-we-do-these-challenges">Why do we do these challenges?</h3>
<p>I suppose any answers to that would be as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team. One thing is clear: it&rsquo;s not a competition, and there are no judges, even if there is a &ldquo;prize&rdquo; of sorts. About that &ndash; I think of it more as an honorarium periodically awarded to acknowledge the efforts we make towards this strange goal. So there&rsquo;s no determination to find the <em>fastest</em>, or the <em>shortest</em>, or even, in some abstract way, the <em>best</em> way to go about things, although I&rsquo;m certain the individuals have their own aspirations and personal drives. As Perl is such a wonderfully expressive language, this provides quite a bit of fodder to the core idea of TMTOWTDI, producing a gamut of wonderfully varied techniques and solutions.</p>
<p>Even the tasks themselves are often open to a certain amount of discretionary interpretation. What we end up with is a situation where each participant is producing something in the manner they find the most interesting or satisfying. Some team members focus on carefully crafted complete applications that thoroughly vet input data and handle every use case they can think up. Others chose to apply themselves to the logic of the underlying puzzle and making it work in the most elegant way they can. Some eschew modules they would ordinarily reach for, others embrace them, bringing to light wheels perhaps invented years ago that happen to exactly solve the problem in front of them today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been considering this question for some time and have found one binding commonality between all of us solving these challenges each week, in that however we normally live our lives, the task in front of us more than likely has nothing to do with any of that . And I think this has great value. We all do what we do, out in the real world, and hopefully we do it well. The Weekly Challenge provides a opportunity to do something germane to that life yet distinctly different; if we only do the things we already know how to do we only do the same things over and over. This is where the &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; aspect comes into play.</p>
<p>So we can consider the Weekly Challenge as providing a problem space outside of our comfort zone, as far out from comfort as we wish to take things. From those reaches we can gather and learn things and bring what we want back into our lives. Personally, I think that&rsquo;s its greatest value of all.</p>
<hr>
<p>Every week there is an enormous global collective effort made by the team, analyzing and creatively coding the submissions, and that effort deserves credit due. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, to try and figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look and see what we can find.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><big>For context</big></strong>  before we begin, you may wish to revisit either of the pages for the <a href="/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-088/"><strong>original tasks</strong></a> or the summary <a href="/blog/recap-challenge-088/"><strong>recap</strong></a> of the challenge. But don&rsquo;t worry, the challenges themselves will be briefly summarized, presented below as we progress from task by task. Oh, and one more thing before we get started:</p>

<h1 id="PWC088TASK1">TASK 1</h1>
<h2 id="about-the-solutions">about the solutions</h2>
<p>There were 32 submissions for the first task this past week. The pack broke along two basic approaches, to either actively construct the product for each element, or to create an intermediary value and derive the subproducts from this through division. There were also a few renegades, out there on the hoary fringes, blazing new paths across the uncharted wilderness. We&rsquo;ll get to them.</p>
<p>The question of overflows came up several times. By my thinking, I figure that if you&rsquo;re riding so close to the edge that a single multiplication will send you over it then likely your whole approach needs a rework. Not necessarily, mind you, but generally one should have a pretty good idea of the range of one&rsquo;s data, and whether the number 6x10^53 is liable to show up in a list of single-digit values. On the other hand if you were writing a general command line utility this case would need to be gracefully handled. So it really depends on how you choose to interpret the goal of the task. Me, I generally focus on the puzzle and the underlying logic more than constructing a robust app. Obviously others here have different priorities, which is as it should be. For a more thorough examination of this idea look down to the end where Abigail and Flavio address it.</p>
<h2 id="additive-or-subtractive">ADDITIVE or SUBTRACTIVE?</h2>
<p>In sculpture, there is a basic dichotomy in method that generally holds: either to <em>add</em> stuff, like blobs of clay, to your creation until it looks like what you want, or to <em>remove</em> stuff, like marble chips, until you only want what&rsquo;s left. Michelangelo famously once stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These particular terms, &ldquo;additive&rdquo; and &ldquo;subtractive&rdquo;, are perhaps a little confusing to apply to the task at hand, not least because we aren&rsquo;t using addition but rather multiplication for our results. However the primal forms of the two strategies remain, and we can witness them here in this creative work as well. Either people actively <em>constructed</em> the product at each index from the values specified, or alternately the total product of <em>all</em> values was first obtained, and then the final products would be&hellip; <em>destructed?</em> from the larger by dividing out each individual element in turn. Yes, at some point each element is first mulitiplied into the total and later divided out again, but on the other hand the total product of the array need only be calculated once.</p>

<p>In the constructive paradigm, at each element of the input array a list of all the elements, save that one, is created and the product taken. Or each element of the is multiplied, but the target value is skipped over and excluded at the last minute. Either way, there proved to be a few ways to implement it, with the net result being the same.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-088/duane-powell/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Duane Powell</strong></a></p>
<p>Duane lays out this method quite clearly. In the first loop we go through the input array and construct a sequence of arrays, each with one element spliced out, corresponding to successive indices in the input. In the followup, this list of array references is iterated over and the product of the subarrays are calculated.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach</span> ( @N ) {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">my</span> @temp <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> @N;
    splice @temp, $i, <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>;
    push @M, <span style="color:#f92672">\</span>@temp;
    $i<span style="color:#f92672">++</span>;
}

<span style="color:#66d9ef">my</span> @total;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">my</span> $array_ref ( @M ) {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">my</span> $total <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>;
    $total <span style="color:#f92672">*=</span> $_ <span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach</span> (@{$array_ref});
    push @total, $total;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Another way to construct the sublist of required elements for each calculation is to create a complex array slice.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>So, reading from the bottom up, in this multiple mapping function each index is first mapped to an array of every index in the input save that one. This list is then passed to a second mapping where it is reduced by multiplication. A special case is introduced for when the list length is is 0, to yield a 0 result. I&rsquo;m not convivced the challenge has any meaning when given an empty list (I&rsquo;m leaning toward NaN), but sure, why not? Just make sure to define it in the docs&hellip; What wew end up with is a very robust functional solution.</p>
<p>In a similar manner we can focus on the elements we wish to <em>exclude</em> and <code>next</code> right over them in the product calculation.</p>

<p>In the divisive paradigm (yea, I&rsquo;m just kind of making up words here, don&rsquo;t make too much of it), the product it taken for every every element in the input list, and then at each element this total is divided out again by the value, to produce the subproduct we are looking for. This approach requires us to first multiply and later divide out each element from the total, but this is balanced by the fact we need only multiply the complete list once.</p>
<p>Because the steps are so straightforward, there wasn&rsquo;t a tremendous amount of variety in this very popular choice of proceeding. There were variations in the control structures to do the looping, and the particular method of producing the product, but the core idea of dividing out individual elelments from a grand total remained consistent throughout.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-088/sgreen/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Simon Green</strong></a></p>
<p>In addition to some basic input validation, Simon has chosen to include a special case for when @N only has one element, deciding this should return 0. Hmmm&hellip; Ok, he says&hellip; As with Julio, above, I&rsquo;m not convinced such a case can even be considered to be meaningful in the context of the challenge as given. I mean, if you have one element, what <em>is</em> the product of the list excluding that element, being the entirety of the list? I find contemplating the whole idea of calculating the product of «nothing» immediately leads me into deeply vague ontological territory. I&rsquo;ve written here before in a similar vein about leading zeros and placeholders for nothingness, but this takes that discussion to a whole new level. There&rsquo;s even a seemingly mystical resonance to this particular instance as well, much like the sound of one hand clapping. I don&rsquo;t think a solid answer is within the scope of this report, so, as I said before, make sure it makes it to the documentation.</p>
<p>In other remarks I must applaud his commenting. Code may well be self-explanatory, but it&rsquo;s hubris to <em>assume</em> it is, and a little guidance and consideration can go a long way in this world. So be like Simon. Simon&rsquo;s got it going on.</p>

<p>There were two submissions explicitly grappling with the idea of overflowing integers, coming to essentially the same unusual methodology.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-088/abigail/perl/ch-1.pl"><strong>Abigail</strong></a></p>
<p>Abigail has given us an interesting strategy to avoid possible overflows by calculating each successive instance of @M from the previous. First he calculates $M[0] from multiplying out the array slice following the first element, using <code>product</code> from <code>List::Util</code>. Then for the following value, he takes this product, divides out $N[$i] (which will compose part of it), then multiplies back in $N[$i-1], the part previously left out. Each successive value is then calculated from the previous in this manner. The active principle here being to never exceed the maximum value contained in the result @M at any intermediate point within the calculation.</p>

<p>Flavio has, alternately, given us three solutions, running the full gamut of approaches. These are two submissions expressing both of the archetypical additive and subtractive solutions, with their faults noted, as well as an overflow protective method that closely aligns with Abigail&rsquo;s. I have to say combining the mathematical efficiency of the divisive solution while avoiding the overhead required makes a convincing case for the method.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always excited when the enormous power of the PDL is brought to bear on our little tasks. Somewhat akin to putting advanced rocket fuels in a go-kart, or perhaps bringing a hand grenade to a knife-fight, the PDL appears to be able to make short work of arbitrarily complex problems in a seemingly effortless manner.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I think interested parties should be able to follow the action quite nicely. Replacing the diagonal with 1s is an amazing piece of functionality that eliminates one value from the product of each row in a progressive manner, being exactly what we want. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to behold.</p>
<p>For a more detailed introduction to and description of advanced rocket fuels, poke around and locate a copy of  <em>Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants</em> by John D. Clark (Rutgers University Press, 1972), which contains many passages like the following tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”It [chlorine trifloride, ClF<sub>3</sub>] is, of course, extremely toxic, but that’s the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water — with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals — steel, copper, aluminium, etc. — because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.”</p>

<h1 id="PWC088TASK2">TASK 2</h1>
<h2 id="about-the-solutions-1">about the solutions</h2>
<p>There were 31 submissions for the second task this past week. With that many variations it&rsquo;s unfortunately not possible to review each and every one, but on examination some broader categories emerged.</p>
<p>The basic progression, as specified, was to read along the top, down the right side, reversed along the bottom and then up the left side to complete one looping of the spiral. At that point, once one complete ring was circumnavigated, the process could then be repeated on the inner matrix remaining. The cycling could be tracked to constrict by means of an offset to the edges, or a dummy parallel matrix identifying boundaries, or in some methods the cells were physically removed. In any case the process is repeated, either through a loop or recursion, until there are no more cells to be read.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most true to vision version of spiralling enacted by the group was to walk the matrix, so to speak: stepping one step forward and reading a value, turning right whenever we get to a border, closing in those borders as we turn corners and read cells. It&rsquo;s somewhat akin to a simple recursion: we don&rsquo;t necessarily need to know exactly where we are, we only need to know how to take the next step forward and when to stop. We start moving left-to-right across the first row, turn right at the end, and continue turning right at an edge or an already visited cell, stopping when we run out of cells. Think of it like a game of snake, if you will.</p>

<p>To keep track of border detection and visited cells, Miguel constructs an auxiliary matrix of 0s, bounded by a ring of 1s, filling in cells on this matrix with 1s as they are read on the original. Constructing this parallel matrix was a common method, as was the exit case of counting the steps to completion, evaluating against the computed cell count of (rows) × (columns).</p>

<p>Niels avoids the complications of switching movement between row-wise and column-wise paths by converting his matrix into a hash reference data structure. By deleting keys once read, he can know when to change direction and when he has completed the read.</p>
<p>He takes an uncommon approach to changing directions as well, rather than ratcheting the index modulo 4 on a fixed array he continuously cycles through the directions to the next cell by shifting and pushing members of a common direction list, always reading the first element.</p>

<p>Because of the discreet, two-dimensional nature of a matrix, what we normally think of when we consider the continuous function of a spiral doesn&rsquo;t really map over very well. We can visualize the motion as moving along each face of the matrix in turn: top, right, bottom and left, and once finished in this circumnavigation we have something more resembling a circle than a spiral. Moving inward one square and repeating, the result is easily viewed as a group of discreet concentric rings rather than a continuous function.</p>

<p>Flavio has a triplet of functions to grab either a single row, a single column, or a &lsquo;frame&rsquo; — being an encircling set of cells, which in  turn uses the other two functions in successive reads. By incrementing  the start values by 1 and shrinking the total lengths by 2 at each encirclement, he keeps track of the offset until the unread matrix remaining is a single row or column, or vanishes completely.</p>

<p>For my own solution I march around the perimeter in ever tightening rings, keeping track of the offsets with a single <code>$rank</code> paremeter that gets incremented at every iteration. For those wondering, the unary negation on <code>-spiraling</code> turns the bareword into a number before the compiler can choke on it. It&rsquo;s a way to be more informative than <code>while (1) { ... }</code>, as whatever that number is, it won&rsquo;t be 0, and I think it reads well. I&rsquo;m open to input on whether this hack is good practice.</p>

<p>CY gives us another circle and offset solution, but adds two interesting variations no one else thought to provide: in one she makes allowance to spiral in the anticlockwise direction, in the other, she provides an undoing function that will take a spiralized list and roll it back up (clockwise) into a multidimensional matrix. In this case, to misquote Lady Macbeth, what&rsquo;s done <em>can</em> be undone.</p>
<p>Her methodology is somewhat different than the pack as well; this is the reverse version, which accepts an unwound matrix and coils it back up. The spiralizing complement function, <code>flat</code>, works in a very similar fashion.</p>

<p>After examining many variants, I appears that physically removing elements after reading led to quite a bit of simplification. To wit: there&rsquo;s no danger of accidentally reading the wrong ring of cells if they quite literally aren&rsquo;t present. Perl arrays always know their own length, so removing cells as they are read essentially offloads the bookkeeping for an offset onto the data structure itself, which is nice and clean.</p>

<p>Adam creates four helper functions to lop off parts of the matrix as they are processed, yielding a very simple core control structure that directly prints the results as they are gathered. His helper functions use a combination of <code>splice</code> and assignment to array slices to remove parts of his matrix once read.</p>

<p>Alexander does his trimming out-of-order, first the whole of the top and bottom, followed by the sides, while saving the values to temporary arrays. This simplifies things quite a bit, and at the end of every looping the snatched component parts are reassembled in the correct order before assignment to the return value. Recursion completes the looping until the matrix is consumed.</p>
<p>I found in my own solution that the symmetries of taking complete rows and inset columns made reversing the bottom and left sides much cleaner and easier to follow.</p>

<p>Arne reached for a matrix module to do the transformation, in this case <code>Math::Matrix</code>. From that point the actual manipulation is quite simple. He reads the top row, adds it to the output, deletes it from the matrix, then rotates the matrix 90°. Repeat until the matrix is consumed.
Very nice.</p>

<p>Julio came to the same conclusion for his process, but uses his own routine to perform the transformation. As it turns out, this action, rotating a matrix, can be executed in a few short lines of code. His <code>rotator</code> function does the work.</p>
<p>The team visited the idea of rotating matrices back in <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/review-challenge-053/">PWC 053</a>, for those interested in more examples on how to go about this.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hold back on my pleasure in discovering solutions utilizing the Perl Data Language. Every opportunity dissecting them teaches me a little more about the data processing power of this amazing tool.</p>

<p>In our opening argument, Jorg takes his matrix and sections off parts using the PDL <code>slice</code> function, advancing around in a clockwise fashion and reconstructing the matrix along the way from the remaining sections after slicing. This is akin to the archetypical encircle and remove after reading method.</p>
