      <description>Advent Calendar 2025 | Day 1 | Day 2 |  The gift is presented by Dave Jacoby. Today he is talking about his solution to The Weekly Challenge - 304. This is re-produced for Advent Calendar 2025 from the original post.
 Welcome to Weekly Challenge #304! 304 is many things: A compound number (24 * 19), the area code for West Virginia, a common and corrosion-resistant alloy of stainless steel, (with leading zero) an album by Jewel that Todd in the Shadows calls a Trainwrecord, and an HTTP error code.</description>

      <description>Advent Calendar 2025 | Day 1 | Day 2 |  The gift is presented by Ali Moradi. Today he is talking about his solution to The Weekly Challenge - 303. This is re-produced for Advent Calendar 2025 from the original post.
 Task #1  We find all 3 variations of digits, and check if it is even, then remove the duplicates:
#!/usr/bin/env perl use strict; use warnings; use Algorithm::Combinatorics qw(variations); use List::Util qw(uniq); use Data::Show; sub three_digits_even{ @{$_[0]} = sort{$a &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; $b} @{$_[0]}; uniq map{join &amp;#39;&amp;#39;,@$_} grep{$_-&amp;gt;[0] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I took my wife and twins to London Perl Workshop. They came not only to see me give a talk, but also to watch me launch my first book, titled &amp;ldquo;Design Patterns in Modern Perl&amp;rdquo;.

The twins were excited to see if their dad was famous. To them, I am a superhero.
The day started with a hiccup—our local train station was closed for some reason, so bus services were provided instead.</description>
