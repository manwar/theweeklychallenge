      <title>DBIx::Class::Async - UPDATE</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT.  Few days ago, I shared a blog post about Introduction to DBIx::Class::Async. It was well received and got many encouraging comments about DBIx::Class::Async.
Dave Cross asked &amp;hellip;  Do you have plans to move the async stuff into the schema or resultset classes, so you can make it more of a drop-in replacement for standard DBIC?
 Daniel Bohmer asked &amp;hellip;  Do you think you could support cursors in a future release?</description>
