      <description>As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to The Weekly Challenge - 018 by Orestis Zekai in Python.

      <title>Roles in Perl</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT.  TL;DR  The Role.pm module provides a lightweight, dependency-free way to compose behaviours (methods) into Perl classes, enforcing clean contracts using the requires keyword, which is superior to deep inheritance. While the module originally enforced fatal errors for method conflicts, it now supports Automatic Method Conflict Resolution (first role applied wins) and Method Aliasing (renaming a method during composition) for greater flexibility and successful composition in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Perl: Unary Operator</title>
      <link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/unary-operator/</link>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT.  The unary + operator in Perl has a very specific and important purpose but it&amp;rsquo;s quite different from it&amp;rsquo;s behavior in languages like JavaScript.
In Perl, it&amp;rsquo;s not a numeric conversion operator.
It&amp;rsquo;s primary technical aspect is context disambiguation.
Enforcing Scalar Context Perl has a fundamental concept of context: scalar context and list context.
The result of an operation can change dramatically depending on the context it&amp;rsquo;s evaluated in.</description>
