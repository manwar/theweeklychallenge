      <description>As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to The Weekly Challenge - 018 by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was pleasant surprise to receive solutions in something other than Perl and Raku.

      <title>bless vs Class::Mite</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT.  TL;DR  Class::Mite gives you Moo-like syntax (classes, roles, and attributes) with almost zero runtime cost. Itâ€™s a thin wrapper over bless, preserving native Perl speed while reducing boilerplate and improving readability.
In my previous post, I introduced Class::Mite, a lightweight, dependency-free Class and Role system for Perl. Since then I have added Class::More that supports basic attributes feature with key has same as Moo.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT.  TL;DR  a) Added Class.pm for lightweight constructors + BUILD hook. b) Role.pm updated with stricter conflict handling and aliasing. c) Distribution renamed to Class::Mite, small but mighty. In my previous post, I introduced Role.pm, a lightweight, dependency-free Role system for Perl. Since then, the project has grown with the addition of a companion module: Class.pm. Together, they form the foundation of the new distribution: Class::Mite.</description>
