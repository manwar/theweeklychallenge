      <description>Advent Calendar 2025 | Day 24 | Day 25 |  Merry Christmas to everyone. May God bless us all with happiness and good health.
The year 2025 has allowed me to return to contributing the weekly challenge.
The last time I participated was in Week #196 - back in 2022.
That was clearly a long time ago. I last blogged about my contributions was in Week #143 which was in 2021.</description>
