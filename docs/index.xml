      <description>Advent Calendar 2025 | Day 17 | Day 18 | Day 19 |  The gift is presented by Torgny Lyon. Today he is talking about his solutioni to The Weekly Challenge - 339. This is re-produced for Advent Calendar 2025 from the original post.
 Lessons learned in Week 339 Negative array indices – I had forgotten about those.
