      <title>bless vs Class::Mite</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT.  TL;DR  Class::Mite gives you Moo-like syntax (classes, roles, and attributes) with almost zero runtime cost. Itâ€™s a thin wrapper over bless, preserving native Perl speed while reducing boilerplate and improving readability.
In my previous post, I introduced Class::Mite, a lightweight, dependency-free Class and Role system for Perl. Since then I have added Class::More that supports basic attributes feature with key has same as Moo.</description>
