## Introduction
***

<br>

[**YARA**](https://virustotal.github.io/yara) is a battle‑tested malware pattern matching engine relied on by reverse engineers, `Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)` analysts and modern `Security Operations Center (SOC)` pipelines. It lets you express malware characteristics in readable rules and scan files or memory for matches. `YaraFFI` brings this capability natively into `Perl`, no system calls, no temporary files by binding directly to the `C library` via `FFI::Platypus`.

<br>

## What is YaraFFI?
***

`YaraFFI` is a minimal, modern `Perl` interface to the `libyara C engine` using `Foreign Function Interface (FFI)`. Instead of relying on `XS` or spawning the `yara` CLI tool, it talks to `YARA` in‑process. This makes it ideal for embedding in automation, stream scanners, build pipelines and malware research scripts.

<br>

## Installing YARA and YaraFFI
***

You need the native `libyara` shared library installed first.

<br>

```bash
$ sudo apt install libyara-dev yara
$ yara -v
4.5.0
```

<br>

Then install the `Perl` module [**YaraFFI**](https://metacpan.org/dist/YaraFFI) from `CPAN`:

<br>

```bash
$ cpanm -vS YaraFFI
```

<br>

## Basic Usage
***

Let's start with a minimal real scan.

<br>

### File: `ex-1.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule HelloWorld {
  strings:
    $a = "hello" ascii
  condition:
    $a
}
YARA

my $yara = YaraFFI->new;
$yara->compile($rules) or die "compile failed";

$yara->scan_buffer("hello hacker", sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    print "Matched rule: $event\n";
}, emit_string_events => 0);
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-1.pl
Matched rule: HelloWorld
```

<br>

## Writing Simple YARA Rule
***

In `YARA` a rule is divided into `meta`, `strings` and `condition` sections. For a practical first example we'll detect the `ASCII` word `"test"`.

<br>

```perl
my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule TestRule {
  meta:
    description = "Detect the literal string 'test'"
    author = "you@example.com"

  strings:
    $t1 = "test" ascii

  condition:
    $t1
}
YARA
```

<br>

## Scanning Memory Buffer
***

`scan_buffer` is the most common in-process operation, it lets you scan arbitrary byte buffers (scalars) directly. This is ideal for scanning network captures, unpacked payloads, or API-returned blobs without touching disk.

<br>

### File: `ex-2.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule TestRule {
  meta:
    description = "Detect the literal string 'test'"
    author = "you@example.com"

  strings:
    $t1 = "test" ascii

  condition:
    $t1
}
YARA

my $yara = YaraFFI->new;
$yara->compile($rules) or die "compile failed";

my $payload = "this is a test payload";

$yara->scan_buffer($payload, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    print "Matched: $event\n";
    print "Event type: " . $event->{event}, "\n";
});
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-2.pl
Matched: TestRule
Event type: rule_match
Matched: TestRule
Event type: string_match
```

<br>

### Important Practical Notes:

<br>

- Binary data & binmode:

    Ensure any data read from files or sockets is treated as raw bytes (Perl's `binmode` or `read_file(..., binmode => ':raw')`). `scan_buffer` expects a `Perl` scalar containing the bytes to scan.

- Large buffers:

    Scanning very large buffers in one call consumes memory and may be slow. For very large inputs consider chunking and scanning each chunk with `scan_buffer`. Because `YaraFFI` (currently) does not report match offsets by default, if you need exact byte positions you must enable the experimental `enable_offsets` option and track chunk offsets yourself.

- Callback behaviour:

    The callback is invoked for `rule_match` and `string_match` events by default. The supplied event object stringifies to the `rule name` but also contains a hash-like structure e.g. `{ event => 'rule_match', rule => 'RuleName' }`.

- Concurrency:

    `FFI::Platypus` closures capture `Perl` state; concurrency models vary — prefer process-level parallelism for heavy scanning workloads until you've tested threads in your environment.

<br>

### Collecting matches into an array:

<br>

### File: `ex-3.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule TestRule {
  meta:
    description = "Detect the literal string 'test'"
    author = "you@example.com"

  strings:
    $t1 = "test" ascii

  condition:
    $t1
}
YARA

my $yara = YaraFFI->new;
$yara->compile($rules) or die "compile failed";

my $payload = "this is a test payload";

my @hits;
$yara->scan_buffer($payload, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    push @hits, $event;
});

print scalar(@hits) . " matches found.\n";
foreach my $e (@hits) {
    print "- " . $e->{rule} . " (" . $e->{event} . ")\n";
}
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-3.pl
2 matches found.
- TestRule (rule_match)
- TestRule (string_match)
```

<br>

## Scanning File
***

`scan_file` in `YaraFFI` is a convenience wrapper that reads the file into memory and calls `scan_buffer`. For small-to-medium files this is usually the easiest option.

<br>

### File: `ex-4.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;

die "Usage: $0 <file>\n" unless @ARGV == 1;
my $path = $ARGV[0];

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule TestRule {
  meta:
    description = "Detect the literal string 'test'"
    author = "you@example.com"

  strings:
    $t1 = "test" ascii

  condition:
    $t1
}
YARA

my $yara = YaraFFI->new;
$yara->compile($rules) or die "compile failed";

$yara->scan_file($path, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    print "[event=$event->{event}] rule=$event->{rule}\n";
});
```

<br>

Let's first create a malicious file, `malicious.bin`, for the demo purpose.

<br>

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=malicious.bin bs=1K count=64 2>/dev/null
$ printf 'test' | dd of=malicious.bin bs=1 seek=16384 conv=notrunc 2>/dev/null
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-4.pl malicious.bin
[event=rule_match] rule=TestRule
[event=string_match] rule=TestRule
```

<br>

### Practical considerations:

<br>

- Large files: `scan_file` slurps the whole file. For very large files read the file in chunks and call `scan_buffer` per chunk while tracking chunk offsets externally.

- Binary mode: `scan_file` uses binary read (`:raw`). If you implement your own reader, always open files with `binmode` on Windows to avoid `CRLF` conversions.

- Directory scanning: To scan many files, use `File::Find` or `Path::Tiny` to iterate and call `scan_file` for each regular file.

<br>

### Chunked scanning pattern:

<br>

### File: `ex-5.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;

die "Usage: $0 <file>\n" unless @ARGV == 1;
my $path = $ARGV[0];

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule TestRule {
  meta:
    description = "Detect the literal string 'test'"
    author = "you@example.com"

  strings:
    $t1 = "test" ascii

  condition:
    $t1
}
YARA

my $yara = YaraFFI->new;
$yara->compile($rules) or die "compile failed";

open my $fh, '<:raw', $path or die "open $path: $!";

my $chunk_size = 1024;
my $offset     = 0;
my $overlap    = 4096;
my $carry      = '';

while (1) {
    my $buf;
    my $read = read($fh, $buf, $chunk_size);
    last unless $read;

    my $to_scan = $carry . $buf;
    my $chunk_start = $offset - length($carry);

    $yara->scan_buffer($to_scan, sub {
        my ($event) = @_;
        print "[event=$event->{event}] rule=$event->{rule} (chunk start: $chunk_start)\n";
    }, emit_string_events => 1);

    if (length($to_scan) > $overlap) {
        $carry = substr($to_scan, -$overlap);
    } else {
        $carry = $to_scan;
    }

    $offset += $read;
}

close $fh;
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-5.pl malicious.bin
[event=rule_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 12288)
[event=string_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 12288)
[event=rule_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 13312)
[event=string_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 13312)
[event=rule_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 14336)
[event=string_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 14336)
[event=rule_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 15360)
[event=string_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 15360)
[event=rule_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 16384)
[event=string_match] rule=TestRule (chunk start: 16384)
```

<br>

## Callback Events
***

`YaraFFI` exposes matches to your `Perl` code via a small, friendly event object (the `YaraFFI::Event` class). The object is blessed but intentionally minimal, it stringifies to the rule name so simple test scripts can say `$event` and get a readable output. It also behaves like a `hashref` for more detailed inspection in tests or tooling.

Typical events you'll observe with this minimal binding:

- `rule_match`: indicates a rule matched. The object has at least `{ event => 'rule_match', rule => 'RuleName' }`.

- `string_match`: a lightweight stand-in for when a string inside a rule matched; it carries `{ event => 'string_match', rule => 'RuleName', string_id => '$...' }`.

<br>

The goal of `YaraFFI` is simplicity and predictability. Instead of exposing the full complex `YR_RULE` struct and offsets (which differ across `libyara` versions), `YaraFFI` maps the most useful information into a stable `Perl` object you can inspect or stringify.

<br>

## Advanced Event Types
***

`YaraFFI` now supports additional event types beyond the basic `rule_match` and `string_match` events. These advanced events provide more detailed scanning information and can be enabled on demand.

<br>

### Available Event Types

<br>

#### rule_not_match

Emitted when a rule does not match the scanned data. This is useful for understanding which rules were evaluated but did not trigger.

```perl
$yara->scan_buffer($data, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    if ($event->{event} eq 'rule_not_match') {
        print "Rule $event->{rule} did not match\n";
    }
}, emit_not_match_events => 1);
```

<br>

#### import_module

Emitted when a YARA module is imported during rule compilation or scanning.

```perl
$yara->scan_buffer($data, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    if ($event->{event} eq 'import_module') {
        print "Module imported: $event->{module_name}\n";
    }
}, emit_import_events => 1);
```

<br>

#### scan_finished

Emitted when the scanning operation completes. This event is always the last one emitted and can be used to trigger post-scan actions.

```perl
$yara->scan_buffer($data, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    if ($event->{event} eq 'scan_finished') {
        print "Scanning completed\n";
    }
}, emit_finished_events => 1);
```

<br>

### Event Configuration Options

<br>

All advanced event types are disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility. You can enable them individually:

```perl
$yara->scan_buffer($data, $callback,
    emit_string_events    => 1,  # default: 1
    emit_not_match_events => 1,  # default: 0
    emit_import_events    => 1,  # default: 0
    emit_finished_events  => 1,  # default: 0
);
```

<br>

### Complete Example with All Event Types

<br>

### File: `ex-6.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule MatchingRule {
    strings:
        $s = "malware"
    condition:
        $s
}

rule NonMatchingRule {
    strings:
        $x = "benign"
    condition:
        $x
}
YARA

my $yara = YaraFFI->new;
$yara->compile($rules) or die "compile failed";

my $data = "This contains malware signature";

$yara->scan_buffer($data, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;

    if ($event->{event} eq 'rule_match') {
        print "[MATCH] Rule: $event->{rule}\n";
    }
    elsif ($event->{event} eq 'rule_not_match') {
        print "[NO MATCH] Rule: $event->{rule}\n";
    }
    elsif ($event->{event} eq 'string_match') {
        print "[STRING] Rule: $event->{rule}, String: $event->{string_id}\n";
    }
    elsif ($event->{event} eq 'import_module') {
        print "[IMPORT] Module: $event->{module_name}\n";
    }
    elsif ($event->{event} eq 'scan_finished') {
        print "[FINISHED] Scan completed\n";
    }
},
    emit_not_match_events => 1,
    emit_import_events    => 1,
    emit_finished_events  => 1
);
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-6.pl
[MATCH] Rule: MatchingRule
[STRING] Rule: MatchingRule, String: $
[NO MATCH] Rule: NonMatchingRule
[FINISHED] Scan completed
```

<br>

### Event Order Guarantee

<br>

When multiple event types are enabled, events are emitted in the following order:

1. `rule_match` or `rule_not_match` (one per rule evaluated)
2. `string_match` (if `emit_string_events` is enabled, follows each `rule_match`)
3. `import_module` (if any modules are imported)
4. `scan_finished` (always last if enabled)

<br>

## Limitations
***

This module is intentionally minimal. That keeps the `API` stable and easy to understand but it also means a number of features are not present yet. Be aware of these before you build on `YaraFFI`:

- Limited match offsets and metadata - by default, exact byte offsets and rule metadata are not extracted. These features are available experimentally via `enable_offsets` and `enable_metadata` options, but they are disabled by default due to `YARA` version compatibility concerns.

- No modules / external variables - `YARA` modules (e.g. `PE`, `ELF`) and providing external variables to rules are not implemented.

- Assumes `libyara` ABI compatibility — the callback currently probes the `YR_RULE` structure at runtime to find the identifier pointer. This is fragile across very old/new `YARA` versions; test with your target `libyara` version.

- Scan flags hardcoded to `0` — no mechanism exposed yet to change `YARA` scan flags (e.g., `SCAN_FLAGS_PROCESS_MEMORY` in some deployments).

<br>

### Why This Design Matters?

<br>

Embedding `YARA` with `FFI` is about speed and control. Calling the `CLI` in a subprocess works, but it costs process startup time and complicates embedding in long-running daemons. The small, well-defined surface area of `YaraFFI` keeps it practical for automation tasks like pre-commit scans, CI checks or evidence triage.

<br>

### Troubleshooting

<br>

- If `yr_initialize()` fails, ensure `libyara` is installed and the shared library (`libyara.so`, `libyara.dylib`) is on your library path.

- If compile returns `false`, double-check your rule syntax with the `yara` CLI (e.g. `yara -s myrules.yar`) to rule out syntax errors.

- On mismatched libyara versions you may see the warning `DEBUG: Could not find valid rule name` - this is the callback failing to locate the identifier field in the `YR_RULE` structure.

<br>

## Example
***

### File: `ex-7.pl`

```perl
use YaraFFI;
use File::Slurp qw(read_file);

die "Usage: $0 <file>" unless @ARGV == 1;
my ($file) = @ARGV;

my $rules = <<'YARA';
rule DemoRule {
    strings:
        $s1 = "test" ascii
    condition:
        $s1
}
YARA

my $y = YaraFFI->new;
$y->compile($rules) or die "Failed to compile rules";

my $content = read_file($file, binmode => ':raw');

my $matches = 0;
$y->scan_buffer($content, sub {
    my ($event) = @_;
    print "Match: $event\n";
    $matches++;
});

print "Total matches: $matches\n";
```

<br>

### Output

<br>

```bash
$ perl ex-7.pl malicious.bin
Match: DemoRule
Match: DemoRule
Total matches: 2
```
