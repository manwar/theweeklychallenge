Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Lubos Kolouch**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 024](/blog/meet-the-champion-024)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 025](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-025)** winner **Yet Ebreo**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Yet Ebreo:** I started programming when I was **12**. My first ever code was written in **mIRC** scripting language. Back then, I just wanted to do things automatically I didn't know that I was already **"programming"**. I graduated college with a **Bachelor of Science** Degree in **Electronics and Communication** last **2009**. A year after, I started working at a semiconductor company as **Test Development Engineer** where I used mainly **C++** and **Perl** for data extraction (or just about anything else). Fast forward to this date, I am working as a **Test/Product Engineer** for an FPGA company still using **C++/Perl**. During my spare time, I do coding challenges/tournaments in a different site but there are less **Perl** submissions as compared to **Python**, **JS** etc.

***

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl5**/**Perl6**?

**Yet Ebreo:** I never knew about **Perl5** until I got my first job. That was in the year **2010**, when I learned about **Perl5**'s regex, it felt like I can do any data extraction (and analysis) jobs. I was already amazed with its speed and I haven't even discovered the plethora of modules in **CPAN** back then. And as for **Perl6**, I only learned it when I joined **Perl Weekly Challenge**.

***

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Yet Ebreo:** I was looking for a community dedicated for **Perl5/Perl6** then I found your blog.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Yet Ebreo:** I highly value the learning experience. I've learned about **LZW** compression, which I honestly have no interest in learning if not for the challenges, **Chaocipher** and its history and it also encouraged me to learn **Perl6**.

***

**Mohammad:** Is there any thing you would like to change?

**Yet Ebreo:** For the site, easy navigation on the side bar would be nice. A link to the github repo to submit solution should also be placed in the main menu. For the challenges, I hope there is atleast one task with strict constraints to make it more challenging.

***

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Yet Ebreo:** My rough approximation would be **3 hours per day**, so that would be like **21 hours per week**.

***

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Yet Ebreo:** Yes, In fact, I checkout all of them so I have no favourite. I check them because I want to learn different approach and techniques. I think most of them have been using **Perl5/6** for longer time than I do.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Yet Ebreo:** Be curious. Let curiosity be your drive to solve the challenges.

***

**Mohammad:** Do you find the website user friendly? What do you like most?

**Yet Ebreo:** Yes! There are room for improvements as always but it is user friendly. I like the [Chart](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/chart) and [Champions](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/champions) lists.

***

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Yet Ebreo:** Thanks for putting up this community and the effort to make **Perl5/6** popular again by blogging. I hope we could encourage more users to join us.

***

That brings the end of the conversation with **Yet Ebreo**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
