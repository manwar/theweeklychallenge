For the first time ever, I took my wife and twins to `London Perl Workshop`. They came not only to see me give a talk, but also to watch me launch my first book, titled [**"Design Patterns in Modern Perl"**](https://perlschool.com/books/design-patterns).

The twins were excited to see if their dad was famous. To them, I am a superhero.

The day started with a hiccup—our local train station was closed for some reason, so bus services were provided instead. We took the bus to the next station and, luckily, caught a direct train to the venue near `Great Portland Street`. From the station, it was just a two-minute walk. As we entered, I spotted `Julien Fiegehenn`, `Dave Lambley`, and `Arne Sommer`. It was also good to see JJ Atria (one of the organisers) at the entrance. I hadn’t seen him in years. After a quick chat, I headed up to the main room, where I met `John Davies`, who gave us our name badges. I arrived just in time for the first talk. In the main room, I met `Paul Evans`, `Sawyer X`, `Andrew Mehta` (another organiser), `Lee Johnson`, `Jess Robinson`, `James Raspass`, `Boyd Duffee`, and `Theo van Hoesel`.

The first talk was [**YAARP (Yet Another Attempt to Rewrite Perl)**](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2025/talk/7994) by `Stevan Little`. It was nice to see `Matt` still being spoken of with high regard. The kids were a little bored, as the talk was quite technical for them.

After that, it was my turn to present in the main room. `Lee Johnson` helped me with the microphone, and `JJ Atria` helped set up my slides. I really appreciated everyone lending a hand.

I noticed `Paul Evans` sitting in the audience, which made me both proud and nervous. I really missed `Dave Cross` being there.

The talk went smoothly, at least to my satisfaction. Afterwards, `Paul` started a discussion about one of my slides that showed an example using the `Role` package from [**Class::Mite**](https://github.com/manwar/Class-Mite). The discussion grew even more interesting when `Sawyer X` and `Stevan Little` joined in.

The book launch received good support—people started buying copies right away. There were some glitches on `Amazon`, but luckily `LeanPub` came to the rescue. `Andrew Shitov` bought the book and asked me to sign it on his phone. I wish I’d had printed copies to distribute.

`Theo van Hoesel` suggested I speak to `Stuart Mackintosh` about possible help with printing the book, as `The Perl Foundation` might support books on `Perl`.

After my talk, I attended [**A Whistlestop Tour of Banking Interchange Formats**](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2025/talk/7990) by `Lee Johnson`.

Then came lunchtime.

It was an honour to have lunch with `Paul Evans` and `Boyd Duffee` at a nearby `Persian` restaurant. At the table, `Paul` and `I` discussed the `Singleton` pattern from my presentation. He had a brand-new idea for implementing it more elegantly using `Object::Pad`, and he was tossing around names for it.

After lunch, I attended `Lee Johnson`’s talk [**Processor Deduplication**](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2025/talk/7989), and later `Sawyer X`’s talk [**Probably the fastest cache in the world today**](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2025/talk/7991).

That was it for the day, as I had to take the kids out to explore the famous `Oxford Street`. If it weren’t for them, I would have stayed till the end and spent more time with friends.

The next day, I saw `Paul Evans` had released a new update to [**Object::Pad (v0.822)**](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad#%3Alexical_new), introducing a new class attribute: `:lexical_new`.

So this original Singleton pattern class:

<br>

```perl
use Object::Pad;

class Singleton {
    my $instance;
    field $count :reader :writer = 0;

    method instance :common {
        $instance //= __PACKAGE__->new;
    }

    method counter {
        $self->set_count($self->count + 1);
        return $self->count;
    }
}

package main;

print Singleton->instance->counter; # 1
print Singleton->instance->counter; # 2
print Singleton->instance->counter; # 3
```

<br>

So using the updated `Object::Pad` module, I can do this now:

<br>

```perl
use Object::Pad;

class Singleton :lexical_new {
    my $instance;
    field $count :reader :writer = 0;

    sub instance {
        $instance //= new(__PACKAGE__);
    }

    method counter {
        $self->set_count($self->count + 1);
        return $self->count;
    }
}

package main;

print Singleton->instance->counter; # 1
print Singleton->instance->counter; # 2
print Singleton->instance->counter; # 3
```

<br>

It is what `Paul Evans` termed `"Conference Driven Development"`. I loved it.
