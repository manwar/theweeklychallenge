## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the first **Monday** of the month and as you all know, it is the time of the month when I pick a champion among the **Team PWC**. With great pride, I announce `Flavio Poletti` as the next **Champion** of the weekly challenge. I have known `Flavio` long before he joined the **Team PWC** as someone who blog daily on **Perl** topics. Being the co-editor of [**Perl Weekly**](https://perlweekly.com/) newsletter I would always look for his blog posts so that it can be part of the weekly newsletter. It is not easy to write daily blog without break for more than a year now. `Flavio` started with **Perl** contributions but later he started sharing **Raku** code. For the last few weeks, both **Perl** and **Raku** become his regulars. As of today, `Flavio` is ranked `#19` with the total score of `418`.

Welcome back, `Jonas Berlin` and thanks for your contributions in [**Rust**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-123/xkr47/rust).

`Lucas Ransan`, once again introduced a new programming language, [**C3**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-123/luc65r/c3) to **Team PWC**. In total, he introduced **7 new programming languages** i.e. `C3`, `Coconut`, `Miranda`, `Myrddin`, `Nix`, `Odin` and `Zig`. He is also regular contributors of **Raku** solutions (14).

I would like to talk about `Cheok-Yin Fung`, one of the biggest supporter of the weekly challenge. I still remember when she joined the team she was raw learning the language, **Perl**, being one of them. It makes me proud to see how quickly she became a confident **Perl** programmer. I have also noticed the writing skill has improved a lot. You should definitely checkout her recent blogs. Well done, **Cheok-Yin**, keep up the great work.

It is not hidden from anyone that I am a big fan of `Arne Sommer` specially his blogging skill. His choice of blog title and header image are one of the best. Please keep sharing your knowledge and experience with us.

For me last week was the busiest, I did long pending **YouTube** videos for the past week challenges. After a long time, I attempted to solve both tasks this week. I remember when I finished coding **Square Points** task, I had two test case from the example. I knew it is not enough and wanted more. I didn't have the energy to come up with good edge case to test my code. In the past, I have always got the help from `E. Choroba`. He is one of the few members who would have complete set of test cases. So I nicked the unit test case from him, sorry. As soon as I ran my code against the new set of test case, I got 3 failed test. I had to fix my code to make all test pass. Thank you, `E. Choroba` for your guidance. I am sure with time, I can be as good as you are today.

I know I am guilty of not participating regularly in the weekly challenge but, trust me, I do my best. Every time I do, I share it with my friends on `Facebook`, `Twitter` and `LinkedIn`. I used to share it on `Reddit` too but then I realised I am not strong enough to face the `Reddit` crowd. For me, `Facebook`, was only meant for entertainment and personal use. Little a while ago, someone don't remember who, either `Dave Cross` or `Curtis Poe` invited me to join Facebook group, [**The Perl Community**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity). Well, do you think, I can say no to either of them? I happily accepted the offer and later became **Moderator** of the group. A few weeks later, I got the invitation from `Will Braswell` to join another Facebook group, [**Perl Programmers**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers), a private group. I was made **Moderator** of this group as well, thanks to `Will Braswell`. Those who are members of these two Facebook groups would have noticed that I share my post to both groups. Sometimes, I share my own contributions to the weekly challenge i.e. code or video and sometimes I share others code if I like, do you remember, `Abigail` regex magic that I shared.

So why am I discussing about Facebook today?

Someone, don't want to name, made a comment to my recent Facebook post that I post too much on Facebook and they have very low [SNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio), Signal to Noise Ration. Honestly I didn't know about such term before. Also my post are low quality. I accept I am not as smart as many others but I am learning even today after spending **22 years** in the industry. Few days back, I saw Twitter post by **Gabor Szabo**, one who I idolise, saying he has decided to avoid visiting Facebook. After the comment about my post on Facebook, I have had enough and thinking of stop sharing post on Facebook i.e. both groups. I will make a final decision in the next few days. I am going to miss some very close friends who always encourage me. Mind you, they are not part of **Team PWC** but always first to like my post. And then there are some from **Team PWC** active on Facebook and I do receive kind words from them too. By the way, long time ago, I created Facebook group, [**The Weekly Challenge - Perl & Raku**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theweeklychallengegroup). I have been posting my weekly challenge related post there too. Although, we don't have too many members at the moment, I am thinking of keeping my post to this group only, so to avoid any confrontation. More on this subject in my next monthly report to be made public soon.

I would like to end the conversation on happy note with the post from [**Jared Martin**](http://blogs.perl.org/users/jared_martin/2021/08/twc-punting-to-mjd-and-showing-qd-geometry.html).

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #2 › Tug of War {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a set of `$n` integers (n1, n2, n3, ....).

Write a script to divide the set in two subsets of `n/2` sizes each so that the difference of the sum of two subsets is the least. If `$n` is even then each subset must be of size `$n/2` each. In case `$n` is odd then one subset must be `($n-1)/2` and other must be `($n+1)/2`.

## Example

    Input:        Set = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
    Output:  Subset 1 = (30, 40, 60, 70, 80)
             Subset 2 = (10, 20, 50, 90, 100)

    Input:        Set = (10, -15, 20, 30, -25, 0, 5, 40, -5)
             Subset 1 = (30, 0, 5, -5)
             Subset 2 = (10, -15, 20, -25, 40)
