# Get to know about Peter Campbell Smith.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `W. Luis Mochan`, the winner of **[November 2021](/blog/meet-the-champion-2021-11)**.

Today we are talking to `Peter Campbell Smith`, the winner of **December 2021** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Peter:** I was the technical lead on a project to re-engineer the software that keep the San Francisco BART metro system running on time. That was a C project, but I wrote code to keep track of documentation, change requests and the like using awk. So when Perl came along - it's a sort of super-awk - I was interested.  The first thing I used it for was a company internal website in 1995 or so - when there were only a dozen or so websites on the UK internet. Back then, most pages were static HTML, but I needed something to track projects, orders, people and so on, so Perl was the obvious tool.

My colleagues thought I was mad - websites would never catch on, they said!

Since then I've used Perl in the LAMP stack to do rapid development for a number of clients, both commercial and in charities. My best effort was a credit control tool covering half a million customer records for a phone company: 10k lines of code designed, delivered and into production by me and one other person in six weeks from a cold start.  OK, we pinched some modules from other places, but then that's what Perl is good for.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** I'm not sure. I think I must have Googled something and hit on one of the Perl Weekly articles. I'm retired now, so I have time for idle Googling - and every Monday it's now the first thing I look for!

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** I always like a challenge! I also like to write code which is readable and efficient, and have drilled that into many a team working for me.  Documentation never gets updated, so someone has to be able to come in 10 years later and understand the code well enough to change it.

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** It depends on the problems.  I probably spend 2-3 hours most weeks.  I sometimes try out several approaches to see which works best, or looks cleanest. Although in my scientific career I used a lot of maths - cylindrical Bessel functions anyone? - I am only a novice in number theory, so my approach to some of those challenges is probably a bit naive.

But I also like to go beyond the question asked - for example in challege 141 task 1: 'Write a script to find lowest 10 positive integers having exactly 8 divisors' I looked at varying the 10 and the 8 and discovered an unexpected fact when the 8 is changed to a prime number [see](https://pjcs-pwc.blogspot.com/2021/12/perl-weekly-challenge-141-task-1-reads.html).

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Peter:** I do to some extent. I love Colin Crain's reviews and have learned quite a lot from his comments. I don't have a favourite as such: Abigail of course always has concise and accurate answer, though not perhaps always the most easy to understand, but others too have shown me techniques new to me.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** Have a go! I was a bit worried that my style is probably a bit old-fashioned. Until recently I was maintaining several Perl-based websites on servers with Perl 5.11 installed, so many of the later improvements have rather passed me by (how many \n's would 'say' have saved me?)

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Peter:** Thanks for having me, and I'm greatly honoured for having been named champion!  I wrote my first line of code in 1966 and reckon to have written maybe 1 million lines to date in dozens of languages ... and I'm still learning.

That brings the end of the conversation with **Peter Campbell Smith**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
