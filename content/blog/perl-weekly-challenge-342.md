## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #342` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and it's time to declare the next `Champion of The Weekly Challenge`. It's with high regard and respect, I announce `David Ferrone` as the new champion. Congratulations, `David`.

For those new to the team, `David` was last declared champion in `March 2023`. He is currently ranked `#35` with a total score of `684`. As of today, he has contributed `320 Perl` solutions, `13 Raku` solutions and `9 blog posts`.

`Week #341` became very special for several reasons. First, it was the best week of `2025` for guest contributions. We also nearly beat the best week of the year for regular contributions, missing the record by a very small margin. The record is held `Week #333` with `106` contributions; in `Week #341`, we received `104`. With some late contributions, `Week #341` might still take the top spot. Nevertheless, I am very happy with all the support and encouragement.

Another reason `Week #341` was special is the return of `Ryan Thompson` after a long break with contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-341/ryan-thompson/perl) and a bonus creative and entertaining [**blog post**](https://ry.ca/2025/10/brken-keybards-reverse-prefixes).

Speaking of comebacks, we also welcomed back `Luca Ferrari` after a short back. Apparently he has been enjoying a vacation in `Japan`. I hope he had great time. He has returned with his powerful contributions across [**multiple streams**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-341/luca-ferrari).

One more welcome is in order for `Vinod Kumar K`, who is back with contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-341/vinod-k/perl) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-341/vinod-k/python).

On a different note, I must point out that the `Broken Keyboard` task from `Week #341` is a repeat. It was originally used in [**Week #275**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-275). I take full responsibility for this. I should have been more carefull. Unfortunately, this is not the first time, it has happened. It was reported by `Packy Anderson` but by then it was too late to change it.

Finally, it's time to share my own contributions in `Perl` and `Python`. For now, I'm sticking to just one task so I can maintain my momentum.

### Perl

<br>

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use v5.38;
use Test::More;

sub typable_word_count($str, $keys) {
    my @words = split /\s+/, $str;
    return scalar @words unless @$keys;

    my $broken_chars = quotemeta(join '', @$keys);
    return scalar grep { !/[$broken_chars]/i } @words;
}

my $examples = [
    { str => 'Hello World',          keys => ['d'],      exp => 1 },
    { str => 'apple banana cherry',  keys => ['a', 'e'], exp => 0 },
    { str => 'Coding is fun',        keys => [],         exp => 3 },
    { str => 'The Weekly Challenge', keys => ['a','b'],  exp => 2 },
    { str => 'Perl and Python',      keys => ['p'],      exp => 1 },
];

is(typable_word_count($_->{str}, $_->{keys}), $_->{exp}) for @$examples;

done_testing;
```

<br>

### Python

<br>

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def typable_word_count(text: str, broken_keys: list[str]) -> int:
    words = text.split()
    if not broken_keys:
        return len(words)

    broken_chars  = set(key.lower() for key in broken_keys)
    typable_count = sum(
        1 for word in words
        if all(char.lower() not in broken_chars for char in word)
    )

    return typable_count

examples = [
    ('Hello World',          ['d'],      1),
    ('apple banana cherry',  ['a', 'e'], 0),
    ('Coding is fun',        [],         3),
    ('The Weekly Challenge', ['a', 'b'], 2),
    ('Perl and Python',      ['p'],      1),
]

for text, keys, expected in examples:
    result = typable_word_count(text, keys)
    assert result == expected, (
        f"Assertion Failed: Input: '{text}', Keys: {keys} | "
        f"Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}"
    )

print("\nAll tests passed successfully.")
```

<br>

Thank you `Team PWC`, once again.

`Happy Hacking!!`

<br>

## Task 1: Balance String {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a string made up of lowercase English letters and digits only.

Write a script to format the give string where no letter is followed by another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. If there are multiple valid rearrangements, always return the lexicographically smallest one. Return empty string if it is impossible to format the string.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = "a0b1c2"
    Output: "0a1b2c"

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: $str = "abc12"
    Output: "a1b2c"

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: $str = "0a2b1c3"
    Output: "0a1b2c3"

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: $str = "1a23"
    Output: ""

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: $str = "ab123"
    Output: "1a2b3"

<br>

## Task 2: Max Score {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a string, `$str`, containing `0` and `1` only.

Write a script to return the max score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings. The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = "0011"
    Output: 4

    1: left = "0", right = "011" => 1 + 2 => 3
    2: left = "00", right = "11" => 2 + 2 => 4
    3: left = "001", right = "1" => 2 + 1 => 3

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: $str = "0000"
    Output: 3

    1: left = "0", right = "000" => 1 + 0 => 1
    2: left = "00", right = "00" => 2 + 0 => 2
    3: left = "000", right = "0" => 3 + 0 => 3

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: $str = "1111"
    Output: 3

    1: left = "1", right = "111" => 0 + 3 => 3
    2: left = "11", right = "11" => 0 + 2 => 2
    3: left = "111", right = "1" => 0 + 1 => 1

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: $str = "0101"
    Output: 3

    1: left = "0", right = "101" => 1 + 2 => 3
    2: left = "01", right = "01" => 1 + 1 => 2
    3: left = "010", right = "1" => 2 + 1 => 3

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: $str = "011101"
    Output: 5

    1: left = "0", right = "11101" => 1 + 4 => 5
    2: left = "01", right = "1101" => 1 + 3 => 4
    3: left = "011", right = "101" => 1 + 2 => 3
    4: left = "0111", right = "01" => 1 + 1 => 2
    5: left = "01110", right = "1" => 2 + 1 => 3
